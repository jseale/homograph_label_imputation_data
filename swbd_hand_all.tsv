83	sw04082_s85_1-s85_80.TextGrid	deliberate	deliberate_adj	i know of cases where uh we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they <unk> talking about is the same thing they are showing you which is sort of like a deliberate bias which is which is rather disturbing
84	sw04082_s77_1-s77_11.TextGrid	deliberate	deliberate_adj	or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
85	sw02145_s48_3-s48_67.TextGrid	deliberate	deliberate_adj	to be you know not to be crass about it but uh uh whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh uh a professional mother a person for instance that
86	sw02145_s45_1-s45_7.TextGrid	deliberate	deliberate_adj	uh deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother

89	sw02527_s88_1-s88_22.TextGrid	desert	desert_nou	but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just do n't find anyway else except in a desert
90	sw02587_s120_1-s120_27.TextGrid	desert	desert_nou	uh and they stayed active was the uh the military there taking supplies out to them in the desert

94	sw02527_s32_1-s32_25.TextGrid	desert	desert_nou	but uh i first started camping out in the desert in california and then sometimes in the mountains also in california
95	sw02527_s84_1-s84_22.TextGrid	desert	desert_nou	i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which uh a lot of people do n't realize
96	sw03011_s109_1-s109_9.TextGrid	desert	desert_nou	i always think it s like a desert
97	sw02527_s146_1-s146_36.TextGrid	desert	desert_nou	but i do n't think i ever see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in in the mountains
98	sw03495_s47_1-s47_24.TextGrid	decrease	decrease_nou	uh i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values
99	sw02012_s121_1-s121_32.TextGrid	deviate	deviate_vrb	if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone s going to invade my privacy very quickly

101	sw02439_s205_1-s205_11.TextGrid	discount	discount_nou	plus i was going through that t i fleet discount program
102	sw02611_s123_1-s123_25.TextGrid	discount	discount_nou	and she you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and uh buys clothes

105	sw03206_s90_1-s90_16.TextGrid	duplicate	duplicate_adj-nou	and i do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this
106	sw04880_s11_1-s11_16.TextGrid	job	job	uh the previous job i used to have uh they
107	sw02466_s158_1-s158_13.TextGrid	job	job	and so uh i got myself involved in a sales job
108	sw02305_s5_1-s5_68.TextGrid	job	job	uh once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
109	sw04171_s82_1-s82_8.TextGrid	job	job	they used to have job security crap
110	sw04329_s70_1-s70_11.TextGrid	job	job	that was my brother s first job in a grocery store
111	sw04028_s70_1-s70_40.TextGrid	job	job	and i guess another one that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a benefit
112	sw02828_s69_1-s69_48.TextGrid	job	job	so we d have to have some way to uh reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
113	sw02316_s18_1-s18_33.TextGrid	job	job	but uh it s the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours

117	sw03068_s167_1-s167_13.TextGrid	job	job	you need that first job or so out of school too
118	sw04049_s63_1-s63_69.TextGrid	job	job	well like you say i mean if it s not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
119	sw02818_s43_1-s43_12.TextGrid	job	job	and they you know had done such a good job
120	sw02370_s127_1-s127_12.TextGrid	job	job	well it it s his job too
121	sw02229_s73_1-s73_16.TextGrid	job	job	well i do n't job enough i think to develop any injuries
122	sw02525_s78_1-s78_24.TextGrid	job	job	and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store
123	sw03049_s113_1-s113_14.TextGrid	job	job	that s a wonderful wonderful job by robin williams and peter de <unk>
124	sw02566_s97_1-s97_15.TextGrid	job	job	so she had to go i guess get a real job
125	sw03300_s133_1-s133_23.TextGrid	job	job	one in real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job
126	sw02587_s106_1-s106_8.TextGrid	job	job	he did a real good job i believe
127	sw02858_s51_2-s51_29.TextGrid	job	job	and and maybe after we decide to have kids i i might find a job that has flexible hours
128	sw02479_s343_1-s343_32.TextGrid	job	job	they <unk> in it because it s a profession not because it s a job they could get because they did n't qualify for anything else you know
129	sw02441_s231_1-s231_6.TextGrid	job	job	they do an absolutely necessary job
130	sw03096_s155_2-s155_27.TextGrid	job	job	and so but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
131	sw02247_s84_1-s84_46.TextGrid	job	job	uh there s no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them
132	sw02427_s292_1-s292_10.TextGrid	job	job	it was n't too much of a job really
133	sw04028_s2_1-s2_21.TextGrid	job	job	um i guess we <unk> going to talk describe uh job benefits
134	sw03219_s6_1-s6_13.TextGrid	job	job	so you you reached me at my job
135	sw04330_s71_1-s71_22.TextGrid	job	job	i think that s an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident
136	sw02441_s90_1-s90_16.TextGrid	job	job	and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able <unk>
137	sw02061_s274_1-s274_46.TextGrid	job	job	well i b m does n't fire anybody because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job which <unk> you actually are like sitting around not doing anything
138	sw03398_s33_1-s33_8.TextGrid	job	job	i travel a great deal with my job
139	sw04158_s21_1-s21_17.TextGrid	job	job	and uh i really do n't have any job benefits to speak of
140	sw02314_s92_1-s92_25.TextGrid	job	job	but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well
141	sw03830_s32_1-s32_26.TextGrid	job	job	i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband s or what i think
142	sw03074_s2_2-s2_15.TextGrid	job	job	i i think that plano has really done a fantastic job
143	sw02316_s2_3-s2_20.TextGrid	job	job	is is is it doing a good job or a bad job
144	sw02316_s2_3-s2_20.TextGrid	job	job	is is is it doing a good job or a bad job
145	sw02365_s62_1-s62_8.TextGrid	job	job	the job was considerably tougher than we thought
146	sw02465_s9_2-s9_16.TextGrid	job	job	and but it does it does its job
147	sw03375_s47_1-s47_14.TextGrid	job	job	i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job
148	sw02435_s118_1-s118_17.TextGrid	job	job	i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
149	sw02597_s110_1-s110_22.TextGrid	job	job	he said um he should have let bush should have let him finish his job
150	sw02314_s73_1-s73_7.TextGrid	job	job	what type of job do you have
151	sw02759_s13_2-s13_39.TextGrid	job	job	i had i <unk> had uh two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job uh different jobs
152	sw03411_s117_2-s117_18.TextGrid	job	job	you just you expect it to do its its job
153	sw02435_s139_1-s139_21.TextGrid	job	job	and james woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop
154	sw02486_s72_2-s72_55.TextGrid	job	job	and uh so when we are doing <unk> and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
155	sw03551_s100_1-s100_20.TextGrid	job	job	because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know
156	sw02782_s15_1-s15_10.TextGrid	job	job	my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that
157	sw02305_s201_1-s201_9.TextGrid	job	job	i had a terrific job really enjoyed it
158	sw03168_s4_1-s4_15.TextGrid	job	job	uh i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job
159	sw02835_s21_1-s21_21.TextGrid	job	job	thirty years ago i i had a college job uh working as a programmer
160	sw02435_s128_1-s128_19.TextGrid	job	job	and uh i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far
161	sw02835_s165_1-s165_42.TextGrid	job	job	and that s made a difference in the way i do my job because it s so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things even when they <unk> on another continent
162	sw02691_s119_1-s119_7.TextGrid	job	job	and he got a job down there
163	sw03124_s72_1-s72_5.TextGrid	job	job	oh a teaching job
164	sw04618_s27_1-s27_10.TextGrid	job	job	and you can not get a job because of it
165	sw03526_s110_1-s110_6.TextGrid	job	job	and he does a good job
166	sw03796_s106_1-s106_6.TextGrid	job	job	they <unk> done a good job
167	sw02435_s137_1-s137_11.TextGrid	job	job	i think they did a real good job of that
168	sw02851_s73_1-s73_14.TextGrid	job	job	and uh he just quit a perfectly good job and came
169	sw04659_s108_1-s108_36.TextGrid	job	job	uh i know what i m seeing here at m my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they <unk> establishing careers
170	sw02441_s52_1-s52_23.TextGrid	job	job	course my job was such that i did n't i could n't do it as much as i wanted
171	sw04060_s98_1-s98_25.TextGrid	job	job	and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that s their problem
172	sw02314_s91_1-s91_25.TextGrid	job	job	i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh
173	sw02314_s91_1-s91_25.TextGrid	job	job	i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh
174	sw03450_s6_1-s6_9.TextGrid	job	job	my job kind of hinders me from exercising
175	sw02539_s94_1-s94_33.TextGrid	job	job	and uh then you d be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children
176	sw03327_s105_1-s105_49.TextGrid	job	job	for sixteen bucks they <unk> not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do a f you know good a job as i can do but they <unk> uh <unk> too
177	sw03174_s40_1-s40_8.TextGrid	job	job	and you expect them to do their job
178	sw02316_s170_1-s170_17.TextGrid	job	job	they seem to have done a the good job in the past
179	sw02465_s100_1-s100_18.TextGrid	job	job	so everything s changed so much i probably could n't even get a job right now
180	sw03238_s104_1-s104_31.TextGrid	job	job	so i do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
181	sw03138_s36_1-s36_30.TextGrid	job	job	and i told him he s going to have to get a part time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat
182	sw02645_s97_1-s97_10.TextGrid	job	job	i m just happy still to have a job
183	sw02184_s10_1-s10_14.TextGrid	job	job	uh on my job we had a lot of workmen s comp cases
184	sw02092_s90_1-s90_8.TextGrid	job	job	and hopefully get a job after that
185	sw04618_s38_1-s38_17.TextGrid	job	job	because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and did n't get the job
186	sw02587_s96_1-s96_27.TextGrid	job	job	it begins to make you wonder why we did n't go ahead and go on in and finish the job while we were in there
187	sw03862_s59_1-s59_7.TextGrid	job	job	uh it is just a job
188	sw03015_s79_1-s79_24.TextGrid	job	job	as to a company s benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job
189	sw02525_s233_2-s233_62.TextGrid	job	job	an it an i feel bad for the policeman because he s out there every day facing these people this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job
190	sw03756_s125_1-s125_32.TextGrid	job	job	but then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
191	sw02372_s19_1-s19_14.TextGrid	job	job	but my job i m an e d p auditor
192	sw04108_s32_1-s32_13.TextGrid	job	job	uh sometimes too it s used as a dumb job
193	sw03902_s124_1-s124_36.TextGrid	job	job	i also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise
194	sw02314_s70_1-s70_23.TextGrid	job	job	i agree with that because i know personally myself i <unk> been in the same job for three years
195	sw02370_s93_1-s93_14.TextGrid	job	job	well still taking care of the children is a very important job
196	sw04618_s5_1-s5_10.TextGrid	job	job	but in my job i m a nurse
197	sw03809_s35_2-s35_22.TextGrid	job	job	and they <unk> and they <unk> doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility
198	sw02395_s56_1-s56_27.TextGrid	job	job	but they they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories
199	sw03134_s24_1-s24_46.TextGrid	job	job	but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible you know and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors
200	sw02896_s60_1-s60_7.TextGrid	job	job	and my job was mostly the woodwork
201	sw03124_s87_1-s87_24.TextGrid	job	job	so i <unk> school and said hey let s you know find a place that has a nice job
202	sw02759_s94_1-s94_31.TextGrid	job	job	probably the the biggest problem with those is they do n't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol
203	sw02819_s39_1-s39_25.TextGrid	job	job	you know uh as you <unk> talking like police and stuff like that it s definitely a tough job to do
204	sw03539_s44_1-s44_33.TextGrid	job	job	but uh i guess my job change my husband s job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
205	sw03539_s44_1-s44_33.TextGrid	job	job	but uh i guess my job change my husband s job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
206	sw02407_s26_1-s26_29.TextGrid	job	job	but uh still i i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a <unk> up job
207	sw04349_s25_1-s25_12.TextGrid	job	job	but what i found is that they had a brake job
208	sw02501_s109_1-s109_11.TextGrid	job	job	we know what a job it s going to be
209	sw03096_s27_1-s27_24.TextGrid	job	job	uh i guess there s more women in uh what would be classified as a man s job
210	sw02010_s111_1-s111_16.TextGrid	job	job	because i think that i think he did a good job
211	sw02184_s120_1-s120_7.TextGrid	job	job	and all on the job too
212	sw02539_s88_2-s88_31.TextGrid	job	job	so so you would have a job with a company rather than uh radio or television or newspapers or what have you
213	sw03720_s122_2-s122_21.TextGrid	job	job	and um um but you know if you have the type of job
214	sw02545_s127_1-s127_11.TextGrid	job	job	i m like i <unk> get a job some day
215	sw04626_s47_1-s47_16.TextGrid	job	job	and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that
216	sw03300_s137_1-s137_24.TextGrid	job	job	and i got the job that i wanted by applying the the methods that that
217	sw02477_s230_1-s230_10.TextGrid	job	job	oh boy what a good job he had
218	sw03068_s166_1-s166_30.TextGrid	job	job	um i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job
219	sw03068_s166_1-s166_30.TextGrid	job	job	um i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job
220	sw02611_s32_1-s32_37.TextGrid	job	job	you really do n't want to dress up unless you you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that
221	sw04109_s27_1-s27_37.TextGrid	job	job	and if we get have a if we could have a thirty two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job
222	sw02434_s59_1-s59_8.TextGrid	job	job	they both do the same kind of job
223	sw02609_s228_1-s228_13.TextGrid	job	job	well their job is to be reelected by in large
224	sw02835_s78_1-s78_15.TextGrid	job	job	uh ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center
225	sw04366_s41_1-s41_15.TextGrid	job	job	but i just do n't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
226	sw03168_s30_1-s30_20.TextGrid	job	job	uh my job is i m supervisor of personnel safety for the world s largest paint company
227	sw02653_s142_1-s142_16.TextGrid	job	job	and just recently i <unk> changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
228	sw04928_s15_1-s15_5.TextGrid	job	job	i have a sedentary job
229	sw02041_s264_1-s264_10.TextGrid	job	job	because i was actually applying for a job in texas
230	sw02154_s19_1-s19_10.TextGrid	job	job	and i think they do a real good job
231	sw02061_s292_1-s292_9.TextGrid	job	job	and then you say that s not my job
232	sw02370_s7_1-s7_23.TextGrid	job	job	and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job <unk> well unless
233	sw02370_s7_1-s7_23.TextGrid	job	job	and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job <unk> well unless
234	sw03201_s65_1-s65_15.TextGrid	job	job	they <unk> doing a real good job of uh separating it here
235	sw02018_s92_1-s92_17.TextGrid	job	job	like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or
236	sw03242_s47_1-s47_7.TextGrid	job	job	uh you either need a job
237	sw04626_s45_1-s45_15.TextGrid	job	job	i had a part time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six
238	sw02314_s123_1-s123_11.TextGrid	job	job	but again it depends on what job you <unk> in
239	sw02455_s10_1-s10_37.TextGrid	job	job	and uh i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know
240	sw02078_s180_1-s180_17.TextGrid	job	job	now my job s good much better than a lot because i m chapter one
241	sw02018_s196_1-s196_26.TextGrid	job	job	i think there is still some discrimination there where as you know men and women work in the same job
242	sw03658_s70_1-s70_56.TextGrid	job	job	and i feel very strongly about uh children and uh developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year where we certainly proved that we <unk> not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most
243	sw02226_s231_1-s231_16.TextGrid	job	job	boy he just sits down eight hours a day just like any other job
244	sw03331_s67_2-s67_29.TextGrid	job	job	i think with what they have to work with i think they <unk> doing a pretty good job right now
245	sw02441_s248_1-s248_27.TextGrid	job	job	well i bet you there s a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
246	sw03720_s40_1-s40_6.TextGrid	job	job	but that s basically my job
247	sw04649_s74_1-s74_7.TextGrid	job	job	and he just got a new job
248	sw04618_s75_1-s75_16.TextGrid	job	job	if you <unk> using it while at a job i can see a problem
249	sw04628_s31_1-s31_105.TextGrid	job	job	uh while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a and a job i guess uh <unk> list i had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that
250	sw02559_s128_1-s128_7.TextGrid	job	job	and you <unk> not doing your job
251	sw04113_s6_1-s6_7.TextGrid	job	job	they just stay in their current job
252	sw02184_s129_1-s129_15.TextGrid	job	job	and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know
253	sw03636_s111_1-s111_9.TextGrid	job	job	i think it s called a job
254	sw04056_s13_1-s13_19.TextGrid	job	job	and for me this is the first job i <unk> had where they <unk> covered that much
255	sw02442_s151_1-s151_31.TextGrid	job	job	and sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like well i <unk> done a good job because i got worked myself to that point
256	sw02053_s74_1-s74_6.TextGrid	job	job	i just started a new job
257	sw03338_s71_1-s71_13.TextGrid	job	job	well that s he s got a job there
258	sw02866_s202_2-s202_28.TextGrid	job	job	an and it looks like hopefully she <unk> do a nice job uh for washington you know which is
259	sw04362_s62_1-s62_13.TextGrid	job	job	and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
260	sw03569_s43_1-s43_8.TextGrid	job	job	i bet that s a interesting job
261	sw03219_s4_1-s4_6.TextGrid	job	job	i m already on my job
262	sw02611_s82_1-s82_15.TextGrid	job	job	he would wear it if he had to for his job and all
263	sw02316_s185_1-s185_38.TextGrid	job	job	see this is n't a subject that i think a lot about because i m never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
264	sw02759_s106_1-s106_39.TextGrid	job	job	if you do test positive for something they will give you an <unk> o opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job
265	sw02883_s44_1-s44_10.TextGrid	job	job	i made that mistake when i first got a job
266	sw04688_s66_1-s66_23.TextGrid	job	job	my next door neighbor just lost his job in a you know one of these uh
267	sw02010_s10_2-s10_17.TextGrid	job	job	i i think kevin <unk> did a really good job with it
268	sw02395_s157_1-s157_34.TextGrid	job	job	so i i m pretty much limited to p b s which i thought i thought they did a very good job
269	sw04618_s2_1-s2_14.TextGrid	job	job	uh have you every been tested for a new job or anything
270	sw03707_s54_1-s54_12.TextGrid	job	job	and you know it wo n't it s little job outside
271	sw03447_s42_1-s42_25.TextGrid	job	job	so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would usually wear blue jeans and <unk> shirts and the like
272	sw03266_s65_1-s65_8.TextGrid	job	job	or is it just a job for them
273	sw03219_s3_1-s3_16.TextGrid	job	job	so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
274	sw02305_s203_2-s203_9.TextGrid	job	job	what what was your job
275	sw04319_s68_1-s68_11.TextGrid	job	job	i also have a part time job at a law firm
276	sw02710_s100_2-s100_39.TextGrid	job	job	i <unk> uh i have worked on a part part time job uh where i was a collector for uh uh a jewelry company
277	sw03083_s69_1-s69_49.TextGrid	job	job	and then from the other aspect um maybe the uh school itself has has has more emphasis on uh trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh
278	sw02429_s221_1-s221_28.TextGrid	job	job	so i m going to have you know my whole job s going to be based on my clients n stuff like that
279	sw03047_s110_1-s110_19.TextGrid	job	job	so cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree
280	sw04880_s55_2-s55_31.TextGrid	job	job	it it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in in my job
281	sw02465_s37_2-s37_25.TextGrid	job	job	the the job that i do i do a lot of training of our customers for new products
282	sw02370_s14_2-s14_14.TextGrid	job	job	you you were n't supposed to want a job
283	sw02285_s94_1-s94_9.TextGrid	job	job	so that your mom does n't have a job
284	sw02187_s171_1-s171_6.TextGrid	job	job	and it does an excellent job
285	sw02051_s32_1-s32_15.TextGrid	job	job	i mean that was their job as they killed in washington d c
286	sw02314_s87_1-s87_8.TextGrid	job	job	it s a legal job you know
287	sw02989_s81_1-s81_11.TextGrid	job	job	so trying to work myself out of a job
288	sw02645_s204_1-s204_11.TextGrid	job	job	that s much <unk> than doing any kind of job
289	sw04633_s15_1-s15_9.TextGrid	job	job	i think you <unk> doing a good job
290	sw02137_s38_1-s38_46.TextGrid	job	job	and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious be curious
291	sw02137_s38_1-s38_46.TextGrid	job	job	and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious be curious
292	sw02628_s26_1-s26_63.TextGrid	job	job	now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small until they got in junior high school my youngest got in junior high i did n't have to work
293	sw02759_s35_1-s35_33.TextGrid	job	job	and i i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related
294	sw02295_s46_1-s46_11.TextGrid	job	job	and i really think they really do a wonderful job
295	sw02645_s170_1-s170_6.TextGrid	job	job	oh i had job offers
296	sw02314_s93_1-s93_33.TextGrid	job	job	the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company
297	sw04886_s99_2-s99_7.TextGrid	job	job	did a pretty good job
298	sw02658_s246_2-s246_12.TextGrid	job	job	it does the it did a good job
299	sw04022_s107_1-s107_19.TextGrid	job	job	and they in my opinion do n't do a very responsible job of spending that money
300	sw02279_s242_2-s242_22.TextGrid	job	job	and and now i m looking for a job before they have to send me back home
301	sw03049_s121_1-s121_18.TextGrid	job	job	and he has done a really good job of characterizing the uh disabled person
302	sw02370_s25_2-s25_30.TextGrid	job	job	but but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you <unk> going to make at the job
303	sw02502_s5_2-s5_60.TextGrid	job	job	i uh i think we <unk> been doing a pretty good job you know not uh not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh
304	sw02759_s67_1-s67_39.TextGrid	job	job	well there it s i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired
305	sw02546_s37_1-s37_21.TextGrid	job	job	i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws

311	sw02027_s52_1-s52_15.TextGrid	job	job	we thought t i dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
312	sw04049_s40_1-s40_7.TextGrid	job	job	i had it during a job interview
313	sw04174_s70_2-s70_49.TextGrid	job	job	<unk> actually i m i m i m more interested in in in choosing the right j job when you graduate type information

315	sw04109_s61_1-s61_29.TextGrid	job	job	but i m i m you know i m i m satisfied with my job
316	sw02691_s118_1-s118_6.TextGrid	job	job	and she got her job back
317	sw03080_s55_1-s55_36.TextGrid	job	job	my job at texas instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that i do n't get any exercise doing that
318	sw03317_s105_1-s105_10.TextGrid	job	job	he s out of college and has a good job
319	sw03576_s17_1-s17_12.TextGrid	job	job	wow that s a a big job
320	sw02628_s118_1-s118_25.TextGrid	job	job	to her everything is you <unk> got to go through college you <unk> got to get a job you know
321	sw04902_s20_1-s20_16.TextGrid	job	job	and of course i m not perfectly happy about not having a job
322	sw02658_s295_2-s295_7.TextGrid	job	job	doing a good job of it
323	sw03300_s134_1-s134_12.TextGrid	job	job	i read how to get the job that you wanted
324	sw03068_s158_1-s158_35.TextGrid	job	job	you know but then when i went um for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know <unk> state
325	sw02962_s160_1-s160_7.TextGrid	job	job	and the prosecutors do a lousy job
326	sw02314_s81_1-s81_35.TextGrid	job	job	well does your r does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone
327	sw04572_s38_1-s38_65.TextGrid	job	job	and if they <unk> you know if they <unk> on some kind of you know <unk> controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate them
328	sw03238_s96_1-s96_40.TextGrid	job	job	well and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff
329	sw02609_s229_1-s229_8.TextGrid	job	job	and so they work on that job
330	sw03096_s175_1-s175_42.TextGrid	job	job	uh because i would think i think you know mentally uh and emotionally i think women can handle a job and every bit as well
331	sw02370_s19_1-s19_9.TextGrid	job	job	you <unk> supposed to only want the job
332	sw02241_s189_1-s189_17.TextGrid	job	job	but it s you know it s a pretty neat little job
333	sw02455_s84_1-s84_36.TextGrid	job	job	uh still uh there s there s sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that
334	sw03038_s24_2-s24_35.TextGrid	job	job	she <unk> she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor
335	sw03174_s21_1-s21_11.TextGrid	job	job	i do n't know that their job would be at risk
336	sw03097_s55_1-s55_10.TextGrid	job	job	and uh that s my job right now
337	sw03238_s82_1-s82_36.TextGrid	job	job	which is too bad because you know i i feel like i do n't obviously i do n't get paid for my job
338	sw02836_s135_1-s135_24.TextGrid	job	job	and they said well you know he they <unk> he has no job
339	sw03219_s59_1-s59_39.TextGrid	job	job	and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said it s just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
340	sw03284_s29_1-s29_42.TextGrid	job	job	uh you know um it it could even be done while they <unk> doing another job while they <unk> doing you know a job to make money
341	sw03284_s29_1-s29_42.TextGrid	job	job	uh you know um it it could even be done while they <unk> doing another job while they <unk> doing you know a job to make money
342	sw04109_s69_1-s69_9.TextGrid	job	job	and so i have a lot of job experience
343	sw03174_s46_2-s46_43.TextGrid	job	job	if they <unk> if they <unk> not uh you know fully functional mentally while they <unk> doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to <unk> another people
344	sw02336_s61_1-s61_57.TextGrid	job	job	well ford s done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to <unk> six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um
345	sw02759_s51_1-s51_30.TextGrid	job	job	i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that
346	sw03083_s70_1-s70_32.TextGrid	job	job	they may be able to to give the resources that s needed to uh to do a good job
347	sw03174_s41_1-s41_34.TextGrid	job	job	and it it is possible that you know that they ca n't do as good a job uh as they might do
348	sw02790_s70_1-s70_14.TextGrid	job	job	but it s still it s almost like a job
349	sw02018_s115_1-s115_6.TextGrid	job	job	do you like the job sharing
350	sw03115_s108_1-s108_54.TextGrid	job	job	course it s a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today
351	sw02370_s106_1-s106_8.TextGrid	job	job	because i liked my job really well
352	sw02370_s49_1-s49_21.TextGrid	job	job	you know the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they <unk> going to be there
353	sw02226_s193_1-s193_9.TextGrid	job	job	i think they did a pretty good job
354	sw03246_s5_1-s5_13.TextGrid	job	job	i think maybe we <unk> given our teachers a almost impossible job
355	sw02018_s90_1-s90_34.TextGrid	job	job	also with uh women in the work force they <unk> gotten a lot more options as far as you know what s it called job sharing
356	sw03041_s210_2-s210_6.TextGrid	job	job	do n't have a job
357	sw02759_s71_1-s71_18.TextGrid	job	job	uh you find out one way or another if somebody s got a problem on the job
358	sw02792_s216_1-s216_5.TextGrid	job	job	do you like your job
359	sw02349_s107_1-s107_20.TextGrid	job	job	and you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know
360	sw03331_s69_1-s69_9.TextGrid	job	job	i think they <unk> doing real good job
361	sw02370_s185_1-s185_49.TextGrid	job	job	they <unk> going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it s a woman s job or a man s job but because it s dirty and it needs to be clean
362	sw02370_s185_1-s185_49.TextGrid	job	job	they <unk> going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it s a woman s job or a man s job but because it s dirty and it needs to be clean
363	sw02501_s95_1-s95_24.TextGrid	job	job	actually it had been uh it would have been it had been a repaint job
364	sw04618_s32_1-s32_10.TextGrid	job	job	it did n't cause her any problems with her job
365	sw03569_s60_1-s60_16.TextGrid	job	job	and i bet in your your job that you have to
366	sw04649_s70_1-s70_7.TextGrid	job	job	my husband just got a new job
367	sw04831_s55_1-s55_47.TextGrid	job	job	in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties <unk> is keeping a job until you retire
368	sw03086_s43_1-s43_32.TextGrid	job	job	<unk> we decided not to get the <unk> which is actually another <unk> one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
369	sw03096_s188_1-s188_25.TextGrid	job	job	but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of job
370	sw04936_s79_1-s79_25.TextGrid	job	job	it s strong enough for any job where you do n't try to take more than say three <unk> of an inch at a time
371	sw04319_s1_1-s1_15.TextGrid	job	job	uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job
372	sw02526_s320_1-s320_11.TextGrid	job	job	i just made my first job hop about eight months ago
373	sw04812_s104_1-s104_24.TextGrid	job	job	that s one thing they do n't do is is drug testing while you <unk> on the job
374	sw02710_s112_1-s112_26.TextGrid	job	job	you know and you hear so many stories listening to them like uh you know they lost their job
375	sw02828_s66_1-s66_54.TextGrid	job	job	the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you <unk> going to be uh rewarding people who <unk> been doing a lousy job and instead of getting the uh improvement that we want
376	sw02826_s212_1-s212_11.TextGrid	job	job	i have a daughter who just had a second job
377	sw02837_s69_1-s69_8.TextGrid	job	job	and i considered it a full time job
378	sw04028_s3_1-s3_21.TextGrid	job	job	and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
379	sw02365_s109_1-s109_8.TextGrid	job	job	so they did do a good job
380	sw03720_s68_2-s68_37.TextGrid	job	job	i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities
381	sw03051_s170_1-s170_9.TextGrid	job	job	they are doing such a fine fine job
382	sw02184_s105_1-s105_29.TextGrid	job	job	would n't that be awful if you were if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything
383	sw04333_s81_1-s81_16.TextGrid	job	job	i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
384	sw03450_s8_1-s8_26.TextGrid	job	job	and i do n't really get out a lot to because my job to to exercise
385	sw04319_s69_1-s69_40.TextGrid	job	job	and i get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does
386	sw02018_s210_1-s210_10.TextGrid	job	job	well i should probably get back to my job
387	sw02370_s189_1-s189_50.TextGrid	job	job	but i think in between we got a group of kids a generation of kids who did n't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad did n't move in to fill the gap
388	sw03447_s49_1-s49_11.TextGrid	job	job	but that s for my husband s job and not mine
389	sw03051_s164_3-s164_20.TextGrid	job	job	they just they they are doing such a terrific job back there
390	sw02104_s33_1-s33_5.TextGrid	job	job	that s not my job
391	sw02566_s99_2-s99_8.TextGrid	job	job	get a real job full time
392	sw02584_s284_2-s284_29.TextGrid	job	job	i uh i left t i in january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money
393	sw02521_s45_2-s45_18.TextGrid	job	job	the the n f l draft really seems to be doing its job
394	sw03174_s109_1-s109_16.TextGrid	job	job	he took one for for uh <unk> for job hiring
395	sw04618_s65_1-s65_38.TextGrid	job	job	and if they would just say oh this person s drug test is positive we wo n't hire them you know then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything
396	sw02370_s96_2-s96_37.TextGrid	job	job	and and if it s not mom then then dad or somebody s got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
397	sw02060_s29_1-s29_12.TextGrid	job	job	and like you i listened to radio on my job at work
398	sw03144_s144_2-s144_23.TextGrid	job	job	but and i <unk> been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it
399	sw04548_s79_1-s79_10.TextGrid	job	job	i would never in a million years want that job
400	sw04360_s73_1-s73_48.TextGrid	job	job	i mean i have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
401	sw02260_s85_1-s85_48.TextGrid	jesus	jesus	so you know even even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh jesus said the money in the fish s mouth or in the fisher inside the fish
402	sw02145_s2_1-s2_13.TextGrid	aged	aged	well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged
403	sw02305_s181_1-s181_5.TextGrid	aged	aged	and i aged ten years
404	sw02366_s21_2-s21_10.TextGrid	aged	aged	we we <unk> very similarly aged
405	sw04184_s102_1-s102_19.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond
406	sw04649_s99_1-s99_50.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and uh pay and exhaustion and you know things like that rather than these uh uh really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
407	sw02466_s59_1-s59_21.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	right now some of the things i m working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse
408	sw04792_s100_1-s100_9.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	that sounds like a little abuse of our system
409	sw04649_s34_1-s34_22.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	well the thing i really worry about is uh the sexual abuse cases you read about
410	sw04166_s26_2-s26_20.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
411	sw03294_s134_2-s134_31.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	and and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed because it s subject to abuse
412	sw03256_s6_1-s6_60.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_nou	and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that
413	sw03012_s136_1-s136_4.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_vrb	and they abuse that
414	sw02597_s50_1-s50_25.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_vrb	and they <unk> they do n't you know they do n't go out and abuse drugs
415	sw03049_s138_1-s138_15.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_vrb	i think it s time we had a lady abuse the guys movie
416	sw04928_s117_1-s117_27.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_vrb	when you <unk> young you you can abuse your your all your systems
417	sw04826_s124_1-s124_29.TextGrid	abuse	abuse_vrb	with all this do n't hurt the kids and do n't abuse their rights you <unk> also taken something away from the discipline i think
418	sw02421_s22_1-s22_13.TextGrid	affect	affect	i do n't know how that s going to affect uh
419	sw02060_s49_1-s49_34.TextGrid	affect	affect	i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably do n't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
420	sw04022_s29_1-s29_39.TextGrid	affect	affect	especially the democratic candidates do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point
421	sw02502_s35_1-s35_34.TextGrid	affect	affect	but i think just a lot of times if we do n't then then it then that influence will affect our country too for one
422	sw03541_s43_1-s43_24.TextGrid	affect	affect	well you know like other things if they do n't affect you you do n't worry about them too much
423	sw02461_s100_1-s100_45.TextGrid	affect	affect	and you know that s going to that s going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
424	sw02299_s65_1-s65_15.TextGrid	affiliate	affiliate_nou	and i do n't know what affiliate of <unk> <unk> you have up there
425	sw03030_s23_1-s23_9.TextGrid	elaborate	elaborate_adj	and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals
426	sw03473_s87_1-s87_38.TextGrid	elaborate	elaborate_adj	well that s why chuck i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you did n't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
427	sw03586_s44_1-s44_19.TextGrid	elaborate	elaborate_adj	well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it
428	sw02372_s104_1-s104_18.TextGrid	elaborate	elaborate_adj	it s not a uh a uh real elaborate local area network
429	sw03030_s87_1-s87_10.TextGrid	elaborate	elaborate_adj	so you know they would be pretty elaborate
430	sw03113_s7_1-s7_46.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	uh but then when you <unk> things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that
431	sw02648_s1_1-s1_14.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	so well this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day
432	sw02041_s1_1-s1_15.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes
433	sw04064_s49_1-s49_53.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	but i think i think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board
434	sw03476_s77_1-s77_23.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	or you have highway signs saying speed limit uh eighty eighty five whatever would be the appropriate number
435	sw03596_s3_1-s3_5.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	very appropriate i guess
436	sw04340_s48_2-s48_61.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	what what do you think is uh is an appropriate uh punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that
437	sw02554_s152_1-s152_17.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	well i m not real sure that s that s appropriate
438	sw02027_s52_1-s52_15.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	we thought t i dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
439	sw04697_s4_1-s4_47.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	uh so that uh a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day
440	sw03682_s45_1-s45_19.TextGrid	appropriate	appropriate_adj	and naturally this is appropriate because i m planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night
441	sw03445_s131_1-s131_25.TextGrid	associate	associate_vrb	i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see over at the medical school
442	sw04659_s25_1-s25_27.TextGrid	associate	associate_adj-nou	a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
443	sw02521_s74_1-s74_12.TextGrid	attribute	attribute_vrb	and you ca n't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
444	sw02421_s6_1-s6_22.TextGrid	object	object_vrb	because i ca n't really see why anyone um who has nothing to hide would object
445	sw03051_s15_1-s15_7.TextGrid	object	object_vrb	i would not object if anybody did
446	sw02020_s39_1-s39_34.TextGrid	object	object_vrb	the one thing i do object to about rap music is is when it becomes militant or if it s uh violence oriented
447	sw03256_s34_1-s34_32.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	i do n't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent <unk> uh you know reason to not use capital punishment
448	sw04691_s124_1-s124_13.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	i think it s an excuse to do nothing
449	sw02667_s27_1-s27_9.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	and i kind of use that as an excuse
450	sw03206_s79_1-s79_16.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	but that is an excuse and that would i could live with
451	sw04079_s15_1-s15_16.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	i do n't know if that s an excuse for not having a tight budget
452	sw03256_s48_1-s48_39.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is unfortunate for that person and yet should n't be an excuse
453	sw03206_s83_1-s83_12.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	if you <unk> busy that has always been a legitimate excuse
454	sw02826_s23_1-s23_6.TextGrid	excuse	excuse_nou	you hear this as an excuse

802	sw03073_s224_1-s224_39.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and he walked around the house with his <unk> face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he would n't let anybody pull it
803	sw04633_s115_1-s115_8.TextGrid	house	house_nou	we had a house and a home and

834	sw03051_s156_1-s156_19.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and i i do n't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
835	sw03756_s147_1-s147_12.TextGrid	house	house_nou	so that was really worth it painting his own house
836	sw03688_s38_1-s38_28.TextGrid	house	house_nou	our house when i when i was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house
837	sw03688_s38_1-s38_28.TextGrid	house	house_nou	our house when i when i was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house

841	sw02365_s37_1-s37_13.TextGrid	house	house_nou	my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den
842	sw04626_s82_1-s82_29.TextGrid	house	house_nou	someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i do n't have
843	sw02832_s6_1-s6_20.TextGrid	house	house_nou	oh it s uh it looks like a little shot gun house almost
844	sw03317_s46_1-s46_40.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and the garages were always if the house <unk> was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have
845	sw02775_s42_1-s42_34.TextGrid	house	house_nou	in a big city like that most houses i would think would be sort of like what we live in just a you know basic tract house
846	sw02365_s78_1-s78_10.TextGrid	house	house_nou	but all the trim around the house was uh
847	sw02492_s97_1-s97_18.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and uh it was quite a drag because um we got them in our house
848	sw03090_s117_1-s117_19.TextGrid	house	house_nou	you should have one in the in the in the house
849	sw03188_s92_1-s92_8.TextGrid	house	house_nou	well what about the trim in your house
850	sw02370_s16_2-s16_52.TextGrid	house	house_nou	there was not there s not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day

853	sw03517_s131_1-s131_34.TextGrid	house	house_nou	but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it it had sat empty for the better part of a year
854	sw03011_s75_1-s75_7.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and we have a three bedroom house
855	sw02832_s286_1-s286_13.TextGrid	house	house_nou	so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house
856	sw02365_s158_1-s158_7.TextGrid	house	house_nou	we painted the house to uh
857	sw03584_s54_1-s54_15.TextGrid	house	house_nou	you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house

859	sw04378_s23_1-s23_18.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and this was a a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions
860	sw04090_s41_1-s41_32.TextGrid	house	house_nou	in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half
861	sw02501_s81_1-s81_16.TextGrid	house	house_nou	so she told us that the house had been uh professionally painted recently
862	sw03584_s14_1-s14_12.TextGrid	house	house_nou	so it s got real high ceilings on half the house
863	sw02012_s184_1-s184_12.TextGrid	house	house_nou	but no one is just welcome to come by my house
864	sw03237_s183_1-s183_12.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and that s just like a mile or two from our house
865	sw02079_s18_1-s18_32.TextGrid	house	house_nou	but as far as the costs for what you <unk> getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it
866	sw03325_s112_1-s112_16.TextGrid	house	house_nou	well d now does your cat sleep in the house

909	sw03051_s189_1-s189_52.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and uh the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house
910	sw02510_s278_1-s278_14.TextGrid	house	house_nou	and we finally got her you know house trained and everything
911	sw03237_s140_1-s140_8.TextGrid	house	house_nou	well our house was <unk> uh

913	sw04796_s45_1-s45_44.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	uh because that s a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that does n't do it that does n't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact
914	sw04032_s69_1-s69_14.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	um it they call it a low impact <unk>
915	sw04151_s54_1-s54_39.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	i would think you d make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there s there s protestors out here at the you know
916	sw04376_s62_1-s62_30.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get i think in terms of psychological impact
917	sw02789_s8_1-s8_8.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	uh it s like low impact <unk>
918	sw04831_s53_1-s53_24.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	or you might you know if it does n't impact you directly or if your management does n't think that

920	sw02383_s21_1-s21_48.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	but it s just a shame to me that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well being
921	sw02710_s49_1-s49_57.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	or if they <unk> sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh impact machines or whatever you you can do that

924	sw03333_s78_1-s78_7.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	and that may impact it as well
925	sw02229_s206_1-s206_16.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	but then that was back when uh you know the high impact and
926	sw02041_s220_1-s220_16.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise
927	sw02433_s136_1-s136_16.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	oh so the <unk> the impact would not be good
928	sw02041_s187_1-s187_20.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	and one of the ones that had an impact was uh people becoming interested in alternate practices
929	sw02229_s14_1-s14_7.TextGrid	impact	impact_nou	and then i do low impact <unk>
930	sw02229_s159_1-s159_5.TextGrid	incline	incline_nou	my treadmill has an incline

945	sw03549_s25_1-s25_8.TextGrid	use	use_nou	it s about six months of no use
946	sw03983_s70_1-s70_11.TextGrid	use	use_nou	it s good to get use out of one

949	sw04155_s104_1-s104_17.TextGrid	use	use_nou	so uh i m i have n't made use of that
950	sw02653_s14_1-s14_12.TextGrid	use	use_nou	so that s a very regular use of it that she has
951	sw04936_s73_1-s73_33.TextGrid	use	use_nou	uh the the little use that i <unk> gotten from my router i would say uh i would spend my money on the bits

1128	sw02800_s44_1-s44_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but other than that we do n't use them anymore
1129	sw02896_s123_1-s123_55.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out uh all the parts that you do n't want to slop over onto you do n't have to be quite as precise about how you do it
1130	sw02896_s123_1-s123_55.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out uh all the parts that you do n't want to slop over onto you do n't have to be quite as precise about how you do it
1131	sw02324_s28_1-s28_50.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	because i think they that s an area that the other nations especially europe look down on us like oh we <unk> just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who have n't really attained it yet

1137	sw03086_s75_1-s75_17.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so we do n't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that
1138	sw03549_s79_1-s79_18.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and uh you know they used to use it for leather i think

1144	sw03441_s16_1-s16_46.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your your phone and and and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
1145	sw03296_s186_1-s186_8.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so i imagine they use personal computers
1146	sw02653_s33_1-s33_17.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming
1147	sw04008_s16_1-s16_12.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	um what do you find that you use yours mostly for

1152	sw03409_s33_1-s33_18.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and you just never get to use it the way you d really like to
1153	sw02826_s159_2-s159_45.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i think as uh as uh mother you know i use to think sometimes it s not so much uh it s not so much the kids
1154	sw04572_s13_1-s13_15.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i know they use that i mean they sell those

1162	sw02429_s89_1-s89_19.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	it also depends on who s cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that
1163	sw04618_s42_1-s42_7.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	or this person never use any drugs
1164	sw04698_s6_1-s6_15.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	it s a real easy to use color uh computer

1200	sw02429_s77_1-s77_30.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um you know make a sauce with or something like that
1201	sw03682_s156_2-s156_15.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i i use that for <unk> for rice
1202	sw02672_s122_1-s122_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so that people would use this stuff <unk> over again
1203	sw02800_s84_1-s84_28.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so you <unk> a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
1204	sw03781_s44_1-s44_28.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something
1205	sw02589_s169_1-s169_19.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also
1206	sw02876_s94_1-s94_20.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they ca n't use
1207	sw02634_s91_1-s91_43.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but uh i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
1208	sw03045_s8_1-s8_5.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so we use that one
1209	sw03409_s14_1-s14_40.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	the way i d like to try and use it is um you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time
1210	sw02896_s64_1-s64_51.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine uh trim work where i d use a small brush and uh try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
1211	sw03409_s20_2-s20_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	how how do you use it
1212	sw04137_s56_2-s56_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i d do it i d use it for both
1213	sw02657_s84_1-s84_16.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	it s not a program to teach them to use the american money
1214	sw02427_s383_1-s383_4.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	we use a lot
1215	sw02672_s147_1-s147_13.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing
1216	sw02490_s285_1-s285_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and he showed me how to use his guns
1217	sw04096_s57_1-s57_20.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
1218	sw04908_s27_1-s27_40.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i mean there there s got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could you could use for <unk> <unk>
1219	sw02667_s305_1-s305_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities
1220	sw02896_s154_1-s154_36.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
1221	sw02896_s154_1-s154_36.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
1222	sw02067_s68_1-s68_40.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their visa or their <unk> for cash
1223	sw04137_s128_1-s128_21.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	what kind of driving just like commuting you d want to do it use it for
1224	sw03138_s197_1-s197_16.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free
1225	sw02111_s132_1-s132_7.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so you ca n't use it anyway
1226	sw02669_s107_1-s107_11.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
1227	sw03311_s154_1-s154_4.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	do you use it
1228	sw03306_s38_1-s38_27.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	he needs his weekends free or to be able to use it or a day during the week or something
1229	sw04181_s149_1-s149_21.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they do n't use
1230	sw03508_s55_1-s55_9.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i do n't use as many of those
1231	sw02151_s10_3-s10_32.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
1232	sw02370_s111_1-s111_41.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	that s what i m doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and use those hours to do
1233	sw03045_s16_1-s16_33.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and what kinds of things do you use it for when you us when you go to their <unk> houses to them
1234	sw02442_s59_1-s59_6.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and i use that sometimes too
1235	sw03517_s85_1-s85_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas
1236	sw02504_s167_1-s167_12.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i did not know how to use those voting machines
1237	sw02504_s205_1-s205_22.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i want to show him how to use it so that he <unk> be able to vote
1238	sw02648_s223_1-s223_23.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we ca n't synthesize it
1239	sw02641_s60_1-s60_48.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything
1240	sw02382_s190_1-s190_24.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge
1241	sw02502_s30_1-s30_11.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well you know i use to feel like
1242	sw03188_s35_1-s35_8.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so you ca n't use oil on wood
1243	sw02405_s36_1-s36_8.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so i use it for that quite often
1244	sw03781_s128_1-s128_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i probably would n't be able to use them
1245	sw02502_s214_2-s214_48.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the japanese moving in and the russians moving in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate
1246	sw04327_s28_1-s28_23.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	you ca n't use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
1247	sw02883_s56_1-s56_59.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	the other thing about them is too if you really do n't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and have n't developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things
1248	sw02504_s164_2-s164_35.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	whenever the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines
1249	sw04099_s82_1-s82_11.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i use to play soccer a lot in high school
1250	sw02372_s25_1-s25_29.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i also use my p c to emulate a <unk> terminal for our i b m <unk> and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
1251	sw03086_s69_1-s69_15.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so i do n't i do n't use i mean
1252	sw03409_s120_1-s120_24.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	other than you use them or you do n't use them you like them or you do n't like them
1253	sw03409_s120_1-s120_24.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	other than you use them or you do n't use them you like them or you do n't like them
1254	sw03188_s25_1-s25_18.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	oh well what kind of paint did you use for the um <unk>
1255	sw03317_s80_1-s80_17.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband s family come
1256	sw02334_s144_1-s144_11.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	now i i do use gas cards
1257	sw02314_s102_1-s102_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	they do n't know that i do n't use drugs
1258	sw02789_s180_1-s180_36.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well now they have those uh those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight
1259	sw03237_s64_1-s64_18.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom
1260	sw02634_s3_1-s3_63.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and uh i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me i find uh use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the n r a slogan arguments
1261	sw02490_s283_1-s283_9.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well i know how to use one
1262	sw04618_s97_1-s97_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago
1263	sw03746_s73_1-s73_15.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again
1264	sw02545_s202_1-s202_15.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	she s not going to do it not going to use it
1265	sw02131_s257_1-s257_22.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but uh my m mother and dad use to uh own a restaurant
1266	sw02372_s32_1-s32_25.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so we um we use it s an i b m p s two also
1267	sw03111_s115_2-s115_44.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then do n't use them
1268	sw02789_s240_1-s240_25.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i just use the regular machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights
1269	sw02648_s54_1-s54_41.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemical wise that they use to uh that they are testing with that they <unk> dumping
1270	sw03086_s62_1-s62_18.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and we like here we use the p c s to do that
1271	sw03639_s72_1-s72_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	some of these muddy driveways could use it around here
1272	sw02264_s77_1-s77_36.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and i know that they <unk> going to use you know the money for that to build some kind of <unk> field and that type of thing put lights and stuff
1273	sw02370_s16_2-s16_52.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	there was not there s not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day
1274	sw02545_s132_1-s132_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	because i did n't think i was really going to use it
1275	sw02399_s62_1-s62_33.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good
1276	sw02365_s15_1-s15_6.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	did you use a textured paint
1277	sw04339_s51_1-s51_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i just really use it basically for transportation
1278	sw04372_s29_1-s29_16.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and states c can use all the revenue they can get
1279	sw04175_s94_1-s94_33.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
1280	sw02053_s158_2-s158_25.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	lilly lilly she said she said it s for your daughter to use
1281	sw04519_s85_1-s85_16.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	if he wants to use it he has to go get it
1282	sw02399_s18_1-s18_5.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	do you use them frequently
1283	sw04316_s123_1-s123_24.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park
1284	sw02397_s225_2-s225_21.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns
1285	sw03156_s13_1-s13_32.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so as far as at home use uh we <unk> pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something
1286	sw03595_s69_1-s69_19.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well when you use real people like that i think royalty especially you know
1287	sw02465_s209_1-s209_23.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	you probably use <unk> or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that you <unk> talking about
1288	sw03409_s22_2-s22_9.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and i and i use it
1289	sw02433_s51_1-s51_7.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i do n't use the free weights
1290	sw02229_s169_1-s169_3.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i use tapes
1291	sw02667_s302_1-s302_40.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight room or to uh to <unk> to go swimming
1292	sw03327_s36_1-s36_9.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but uh they do still use plugs
1293	sw03876_s145_1-s145_16.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i use a couple of things from <unk> that it says this is <unk> material
1294	sw02603_s239_1-s239_15.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	which one do you feel is better since you use them both
1295	sw02545_s18_1-s18_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business
1296	sw02883_s18_1-s18_10.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i do n't use them very much though
1297	sw03311_s146_1-s146_5.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and i use the <unk>
1298	sw03090_s5_1-s5_7.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i do n't use a family budget
1299	sw03296_s8_1-s8_7.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i use one all day at work
1300	sw03045_s119_2-s119_60.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful because it keeps track of all your footnotes
1301	sw03229_s12_1-s12_8.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so what do you use for <unk>
1302	sw03539_s42_1-s42_18.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	uh i use to also take an <unk> class about three days a week before work
1303	sw02264_s108_1-s108_30.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it you know that was going to use it for good
1304	sw02154_s148_1-s148_16.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so that s an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use
1305	sw04048_s51_1-s51_14.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use
1306	sw02775_s180_1-s180_11.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so the only thing that i use is soap
1307	sw04618_s92_1-s92_20.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	if someone was out to get you i think that a company or a boss could use this
1308	sw02157_s218_1-s218_24.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and they um if they <unk> not going to use them they <unk> give them to somebody else
1309	sw02584_s52_1-s52_19.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with
1310	sw02249_s195_1-s195_40.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and so i it s a real difficult choice whether we want <unk> cups to fill up our <unk> or uh china cups to use up our water
1311	sw03074_s131_1-s131_27.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she d use that
1312	sw02648_s46_1-s46_31.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down
1313	sw03124_s167_1-s167_20.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	i always tell people that in the winter we use we used to uh
1314	sw02020_s91_1-s91_21.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	because they had n't originally gotten um permission from him to use it
1315	sw02372_s169_1-s169_13.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and uh wait for an opportunity to use it
1316	sw02397_s55_1-s55_9.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors
1317	sw03296_s82_1-s82_13.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but i use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents
1318	sw03449_s101_1-s101_9.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	oh the chinese use slave labor too
1319	sw02247_s50_1-s50_18.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	uh what i <unk> gotten into more recently are the tools to use them
1320	sw02290_s199_1-s199_13.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters
1321	sw02187_s210_1-s210_7.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	our mothers used to use it
1322	sw02067_s79_1-s79_8.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	the idea is to use their money
1323	sw03296_s100_1-s100_16.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	but uh you know you learn something every time you use it
1324	sw02465_s105_1-s105_17.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so uh does your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook
1325	sw02800_s85_1-s85_8.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	can you use that one for personal use
1326	sw03409_s89_1-s89_4.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so i use that
1327	sw02502_s111_1-s111_24.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	so all the persecution that they <unk> sort of use to it it s been sort of like you know
1328	sw02818_s11_1-s11_61.TextGrid	use	use_vrb	it seems like uh even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally
1329	sw02427_s304_1-s304_9.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	he always uses it to <unk> his lawn
1330	sw02121_s47_1-s47_23.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	one of our our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to uh generate electricity
1331	sw02406_s191_1-s191_19.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done
1332	sw03138_s120_1-s120_5.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	is that what he uses
1333	sw03296_s193_1-s193_16.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	mostly my one sister uses hers for her children you know children s games
1334	sw03450_s90_1-s90_19.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	the uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with
1335	sw04902_s26_1-s26_30.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	i mean right now uh i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration
1336	sw04801_s30_1-s30_8.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	i think florida still uses electric chair
1337	sw02397_s50_1-s50_7.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	what kind of cloth uses that
1338	sw02545_s44_3-s44_24.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	she she uh she uses it now uh my sister to
1339	sw02653_s11_1-s11_11.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	and she uses it to compose and print out letters
1340	sw02545_s214_1-s214_13.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	it s all she <unk> uses it for
1341	sw04698_s8_1-s8_8.TextGrid	uses	uses_vrb	and he uses it for his school work
1342	sw02465_s8_1-s8_18.TextGrid	compact	compact_adj-nou	and it s just an old old compact that is super slow
1343	sw04728_s49_2-s49_34.TextGrid	compact	compact_adj-nou	we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time
1344	sw03962_s78_1-s78_26.TextGrid	compact	compact_adj-nou	uh they know have them on compact disc or or uh or <unk> or l p s
1345	sw02131_s306_1-s306_22.TextGrid	compact	compact_adj-nou	and so the best bet any <unk> these days are compact disk
1346	sw02241_s45_1-s45_20.TextGrid	content	content_nou	um where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ash content
1347	sw02241_s31_2-s31_43.TextGrid	content	content_nou	the in plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content that uh uh i went to use my dad in law s tiller
1348	sw02627_s191_1-s191_12.TextGrid	content	content_nou	it s hard to get a protein content up then
1349	sw03607_s83_1-s83_21.TextGrid	content	content_nou	well it uh depending on its moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
1350	sw04691_s164_2-s164_19.TextGrid	contest	contest_nou	it it s not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself
1351	sw04834_s25_1-s25_17.TextGrid	contest	contest_nou	they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything
1352	sw04691_s65_2-s65_32.TextGrid	contest	contest_nou	it it s good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest
1353	sw04036_s82_1-s82_11.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	and it s just a matter of interpreting a contract
1354	sw02105_s146_1-s146_14.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	apparently i think his contract is up after the end of this year
1355	sw02672_s145_1-s145_17.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	and they do n't expand or or contract when the weather changes
1356	sw03403_s88_1-s88_14.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	well did n't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers
1357	sw02477_s218_1-s218_15.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	um if they did they d still have to pay his contract
1358	sw03526_s32_1-s32_7.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	uh i m a contract programmer
1359	sw03238_s101_1-s101_22.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work
1360	sw02645_s55_1-s55_18.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	well i m sure with the new uh <unk> contract awarding
1361	sw04318_s114_1-s114_66.TextGrid	contract	contract_nou	but i think they <unk> obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to g m after you know it s after they <unk> used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it
1362	sw02617_s11_1-s11_47.TextGrid	contrast	contrast_nou	and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the middle east war we just had where president bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening
1363	sw02395_s124_1-s124_27.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	well back during the viet nam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war
1364	sw04345_s50_1-s50_52.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh peter arnett who had stayed in iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available
1365	sw02597_s169_1-s169_15.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	it s like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
1366	sw02275_s83_1-s83_45.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	and they say that uh that there was <unk> that there was like a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use
1367	sw03103_s158_1-s158_15.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	and i think the issue should be settled before there s a conflict
1368	sw03041_s129_1-s129_15.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world
1369	sw02602_s85_1-s85_13.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	you mean in the in the most recent conflict
1370	sw03254_s130_1-s130_10.TextGrid	conflict	conflict_nou	so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend
1371	sw02041_s221_1-s221_18.TextGrid	combine	combine_vrb	and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation
1372	sw02041_s191_1-s191_19.TextGrid	combine	combine_vrb	and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things
1373	sw02756_s49_1-s49_19.TextGrid	combine	combine_vrb	so i usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere
1374	sw03148_s45_1-s45_40.TextGrid	combine	combine_vrb	i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid
1375	sw02249_s171_1-s171_6.TextGrid	compress	compress	they do n't compress at all
1376	sw02407_s115_1-s115_31.TextGrid	construct	construct_vrb	and i think you know you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process
1377	sw02469_s222_1-s222_7.TextGrid	content	content_nou	so they <unk> pretty content now
1378	sw02324_s30_1-s30_12.TextGrid	content	content_nou	and it s like hey we <unk> content with this
1379	sw02383_s29_1-s29_35.TextGrid	content	content_nou	as a matter of fact i m very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything
1380	sw02502_s142_1-s142_30.TextGrid	contrast	contrast_vrb	well i mean how can you contrast the europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in latin america
1381	sw02324_s113_1-s113_3.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	we can convert
1382	sw02619_s64_1-s64_83.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	i guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers er just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and uh just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert
1383	sw02619_s32_1-s32_13.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	cause i still ca n't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters
1384	sw02619_s20_2-s20_33.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	and uh so i <unk> i <unk> lived with <unk> pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over
1385	sw02669_s198_1-s198_51.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty six or fifty seven s a hundred uh <unk> a hundred kilometers
1386	sw02669_s10_1-s10_48.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the problem because we <unk> so wound up in the in the system that we <unk> got that you know trying to convert over
1387	sw02324_s53_1-s53_19.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	and it <unk> convert every measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds
1388	sw02399_s67_1-s67_28.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	plus i would uh when they uh would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate
1389	sw03773_s104_1-s104_34.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	lot of people will buy in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the or do something
1390	sw02619_s29_1-s29_57.TextGrid	convert	convert_vrb	and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and you know and leaving it at that
1391	sw02836_s107_1-s107_25.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	i d rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody
1392	sw04152_s46_2-s46_59.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there s enough
1393	sw02836_s106_1-s106_17.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	so you d you d rather see it harder to convict somebody
1394	sw03503_s79_1-s79_31.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	but you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you d ever know beyond a doubt
1395	sw02302_s5_1-s5_27.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody
1396	sw04036_s1_1-s1_52.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't uh convict someone who uh really should n't be convicted
1397	sw04152_s66_5-s66_61.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	on on on one hand you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it s <unk> they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy
1398	sw04036_s4_1-s4_54.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you would n't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
1399	sw03503_s81_1-s81_34.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah i guess i could convict him
1400	sw04679_s8_1-s8_45.TextGrid	convict	convict_vrb	so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
1401	sw02602_s55_1-s55_12.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	it looks like it s come close to that as it is
1402	sw03284_s2_1-s2_31.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i do n't know that it s ever been seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that
1403	sw02264_s1_1-s1_25.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well since you live close i do n't know if you know um about what louisville is doing with <unk>
1404	sw02053_s56_1-s56_31.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well now can i improvise with adding and using another color instead you know what comes close because a lot of them are similar
1405	sw04133_s83_2-s83_22.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i mean obviously if someone of mine who has close died i d probably feel differently
1406	sw02837_s178_1-s178_10.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	you just put them together as close as you can
1407	sw02792_s130_1-s130_29.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	even if i m uh doing something like an afghan if i m close to the end sometimes i <unk> do the same thing
1408	sw03051_s119_1-s119_25.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	now maybe you know that s pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new
1409	sw02005_s185_2-s185_57.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and i and i i kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know
1410	sw02860_s36_1-s36_24.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and so we would drive up to see that when <unk> whenever it was reasonably close
1411	sw04341_s99_2-s99_19.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i i m in washington d c or at least very close to it
1412	sw03237_s167_1-s167_12.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	it s close to my uh oldest daughter s school
1413	sw03120_s92_2-s92_22.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and because my brother is there uh he would have family close by
1414	sw02650_s209_1-s209_14.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and i think maybe he would if it came real close
1415	sw03707_s97_1-s97_27.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and it s you know i mean it s not even close to even being trained on a leash
1416	sw03067_s166_1-s166_14.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	you do not really feel that that really close to them
1417	sw03111_s16_1-s16_10.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i live here because it s close to the university
1418	sw02549_s247_1-s247_8.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	but it s close to philadelphia and baltimore
1419	sw04785_s117_1-s117_13.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
1420	sw02461_s51_1-s51_5.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	so it s getting close
1421	sw02365_s106_1-s106_19.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and uh it s just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh
1422	sw02107_s214_1-s214_10.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i mean i <unk> never seen two cats so close
1423	sw03495_s17_1-s17_16.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well now we <unk> pretty close to the golden triangle are n't you
1424	sw03746_s48_1-s48_20.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i live uh very near uh very close to the <unk> golf course
1425	sw03549_s8_1-s8_5.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	they both live close to
1426	sw02445_s43_1-s43_10.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	um especially there was a little store close by
1427	sw03124_s104_1-s104_8.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	it was real close to where i worked
1428	sw02139_s194_1-s194_11.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	but uh i guess it s close enough
1429	sw03067_s95_2-s95_20.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	<unk> why do you think that it s less close than it used to be
1430	sw03725_s102_1-s102_29.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well but the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters
1431	sw03725_s102_1-s102_29.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well but the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters
1432	sw03020_s146_1-s146_5.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and be so close
1433	sw02549_s27_1-s27_10.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	san jose actually but but close
1434	sw03131_s166_1-s166_20.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	the child is going why do n't you want to be close to me and your other family
1435	sw02868_s58_1-s58_35.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	so any any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or or something like that
1436	sw04785_s26_1-s26_6.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	so they were all real close
1437	sw03237_s175_1-s175_7.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and we are so close to shopping
1438	sw03746_s8_1-s8_15.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well we live uh pretty close to the mesquite golf course
1439	sw02676_s186_2-s186_20.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	the house that house that i bought is close to a <unk> golf course
1440	sw02502_s129_1-s129_13.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	latin you know is very very very close to spanish
1441	sw02525_s124_1-s124_19.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	but that s uh the they <unk> so close
1442	sw04356_s121_2-s121_34.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the taurus is one of the highest u s cars
1443	sw02938_s250_1-s250_2.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	real close
1444	sw02504_s4_1-s4_33.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i think it s somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference
1445	sw03342_s67_1-s67_29.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	so it s it s so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit
1446	sw03174_s120_1-s120_19.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	from what i understanding here at t i they run close to a thousand dollars an employee
1447	sw02938_s63_1-s63_6.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well that s close to here
1448	sw02295_s69_1-s69_9.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	there s one close to where my mother is
1449	sw02860_s194_1-s194_12.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone
1450	sw02395_s172_1-s172_5.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> pretty close
1451	sw02837_s168_1-s168_13.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them
1452	sw02784_s160_1-s160_13.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i m not sure that i m not up fairly close to that
1453	sw02868_s76_2-s76_35.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	we loved the we loved the the new jersey area too because the the lakes were really pretty close you know
1454	sw04886_s6_1-s6_31.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	about maybe oh close to a year ago now i guess i i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
1455	sw03174_s114_1-s114_27.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and i you know i do n't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together
1456	sw02275_s126_1-s126_66.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and that really made it a very interesting uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they <unk> going to be real close or whether they <unk> just going to be partners you know
1457	sw02005_s149_1-s149_9.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	how close is it to a home environment
1458	sw02130_s40_1-s40_46.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	but i i would imagine that because of the how close the the vote was i m uh i mean almost certainly would have to be
1459	sw02015_s142_1-s142_6.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	uh pretty close to it
1460	sw02549_s127_1-s127_13.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	they finished pretty close to five hundred last year did n't they
1461	sw03353_s15_1-s15_22.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning
1462	sw02547_s142_1-s142_5.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	are you close to <unk>
1463	sw02775_s52_1-s52_21.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	that is one thing that i do n't enjoy about it is the houses are too close together
1464	sw02868_s68_1-s68_17.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	uh and i really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close
1465	sw03124_s136_1-s136_10.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i said i was n't close to downtown pontiac
1466	sw02719_s133_1-s133_7.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	uh just close to methodist hospital
1467	sw02938_s248_1-s248_4.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	they live close then
1468	sw03133_s126_1-s126_25.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> also see that there s there s a different way of life and those families are really close
1469	sw03111_s50_1-s50_14.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	though uh washington i think is uh close by
1470	sw02062_s152_2-s152_30.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	it when i came on it was great because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered
1471	sw03202_s28_1-s28_8.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	with all of you living so close together
1472	sw02835_s38_1-s38_16.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	so it s close to getting uh one t v per person they say
1473	sw03763_s10_1-s10_29.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	but uh you know since i live here so close to arlington uh that s the team that i <unk> been kind of following
1474	sw03169_s32_1-s32_10.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	nor do we live that close to a lake anymore
1475	sw03389_s26_1-s26_7.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	<unk> is pretty close to new orleans
1476	sw02015_s143_1-s143_2.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	pretty close
1477	sw02157_s212_1-s212_14.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper
1478	sw03052_s151_1-s151_12.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	but i guess <unk> s would come as close as anything
1479	sw02423_s68_2-s68_28.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	well well we live we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley
1480	sw02938_s65_1-s65_2.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	real close
1481	sw02295_s6_1-s6_20.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	how do you feel about them i mean since you <unk> kind of been close to that
1482	sw02113_s150_1-s150_15.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	they tried to keep it you know as very close to real
1483	sw03303_s60_1-s60_14.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	i do n't know how close i <unk> follow them though
1484	sw02005_s140_1-s140_30.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	that the people that worked there were very were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible
1485	sw03045_s11_1-s11_6.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> almost as close
1486	sw04902_s40_1-s40_42.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	they can not close off the mexican border not because it s physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country
1487	sw02599_s102_1-s102_7.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> get close to it

1498	sw02405_s23_1-s23_21.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	it s probably pretty close to what i have because i have the same kind of thing at work
1499	sw02866_s153_1-s153_16.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	there s a big difference between baltimore and washington even though they <unk> so close
1500	sw03070_s130_1-s130_15.TextGrid	close	close_adj-nou	my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family
1501	sw04333_s31_2-s31_45.TextGrid	close	close_vrb	but but supposedly once you have an office in d c or you know and and staff it with people it s really tough to close it down
1502	sw02938_s82_1-s82_34.TextGrid	close	close_vrb	in texas i m serious if it gets cold and it looks like it s going to rain i i swear they close everything down
1503	sw02503_s127_1-s127_79.TextGrid	close	close_vrb	like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did
1504	sw02938_s79_1-s79_24.TextGrid	close	close_vrb	but to me texas see and kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school
1505	sw02131_s75_1-s75_33.TextGrid	close	close_vrb	i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen
1506	sw03368_s137_1-s137_12.TextGrid	close	close_vrb	and uh i just close it out i guess
1507	sw03269_s98_1-s98_27.TextGrid	close	close_vrb	well if they close it in see we <unk> have the best of both worlds then as they <unk> talking about doing
1508	sw02395_s93_1-s93_16.TextGrid	live	live_adj	and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
1509	sw03491_s96_1-s96_16.TextGrid	live	live_adj	well i <unk> gone to you know one for real live trek convention
1510	sw03159_s100_1-s100_19.TextGrid	live	live_adj	i think they all that thought well we have a live one
1511	sw02429_s31_1-s31_8.TextGrid	live	live_adj	but they had live crawfish on sale
1512	sw04019_s120_1-s120_5.TextGrid	live	live_adj	there once a year live
1513	sw03403_s31_1-s31_12.TextGrid	live	live_adj	and one of them broadcast every twins game live you know
1514	sw03369_s33_1-s33_32.TextGrid	live	live_adj	in fact the buffalo the scene the big buffalo herd scene that was that was a live scene
1515	sw04123_s90_1-s90_27.TextGrid	live	live_adj	uh and i guess that s good when it s live if you if you <unk> really want that
1516	sw02858_s156_1-s156_40.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	day cares have have have popped up and become a lot more um a lot bigger part of of the kids lives
1517	sw02645_s189_1-s189_10.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	momentum is uh driving force in our lives
1518	sw02792_s151_1-s151_45.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	and um i i like to uh read about people who have been a successful you know who who made a success of their lives
1519	sw04360_s19_1-s19_10.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	in other words they just <unk> their lives differently
1520	sw02184_s86_1-s86_18.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	because you <unk> endangering everybody s lives if you if it s something like that
1521	sw04133_s57_1-s57_6.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	they risk their lives every day
1522	sw02275_s53_1-s53_28.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	even though the person is involved in so many other people s lives you still see a a real person in those situations
1523	sw02241_s197_1-s197_25.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed
1524	sw03720_s141_2-s141_51.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it
1525	sw02295_s54_2-s54_25.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	family and friends are usually well family s tied up with their own lives and things and usually working
1526	sw03067_s118_1-s118_16.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	we get so involved in our work lives and just social lives and so forth
1527	sw03067_s118_1-s118_16.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	we get so involved in our work lives and just social lives and so forth
1528	sw02546_s13_1-s13_79.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	uh you know it it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the state when they so callously and usually so you know without even thinking or without any concern uh you know end somebody else s life and in a lot of cases several people s lives
1529	sw02826_s171_2-s171_15.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	and and children s lives were simpler because mother was there
1530	sw04659_s57_1-s57_16.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically
1531	sw03052_s120_1-s120_29.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	as the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from from people who have been independent all their lives
1532	sw02525_s204_1-s204_30.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives
1533	sw02171_s109_1-s109_36.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	but as far as uh you know the peace corps i guess i suppose there s a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
1534	sw02818_s56_1-s56_15.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	much as other cultures disagree our lives do n't revolve around our children
1535	sw02617_s46_1-s46_35.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war
1536	sw03242_s29_1-s29_25.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	because i look at airline pilots bus drivers you know people that really have other peoples lives in their hands truck drivers
1537	sw03367_s16_1-s16_59.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse uh i do n't think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
1538	sw02617_s129_1-s129_3.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	we lost lives
1539	sw04004_s44_1-s44_32.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	um do you think i mean do you think our <unk> the investment in lives and money was worth it
1540	sw03097_s145_1-s145_8.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	i refused to cram their lives full
1541	sw03509_s49_1-s49_19.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	but then again also you ca n't bring back lives that have been taken anyway
1542	sw02314_s2_1-s2_38.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there s where there s uh endangerment to their own life and other people s lives
1543	sw02617_s5_1-s5_41.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	um looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now i i m not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives
1544	sw02597_s165_1-s165_19.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	but really if if they were going to save people s lives
1545	sw03811_s55_1-s55_28.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	this is a uh a couple uh emigrated from china early in in their lives
1546	sw02571_s45_1-s45_28.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	so i feel like you know that s is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives
1547	sw02558_s80_1-s80_32.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	but i do n't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
1548	sw02107_s88_1-s88_14.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
1549	sw03242_s93_1-s93_27.TextGrid	lives	lives_nou	even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk
1550	sw03188_s64_1-s64_46.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou	and uh the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
1551	sw03524_s9_1-s9_6.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	well i learned something already
1552	sw03565_s53_1-s53_8.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and uh i learned to
1553	sw03152_s224_1-s224_11.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i feel like i <unk> learned a lot about the piano
1554	sw04008_s41_1-s41_21.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	that s what i learned a lot of languages on was an apple two e in my high school
1555	sw03062_s43_1-s43_18.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	so you worked you learned how to solve your problems on your own
1556	sw03070_s86_1-s86_7.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	so i learned a lot about them
1557	sw02617_s191_1-s191_22.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	but well i just i i m glad we <unk> learned
1558	sw02790_s134_1-s134_8.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	they never learned to be responsible when
1559	sw02439_s182_1-s182_10.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	or maybe more than that as i <unk> learned
1560	sw03085_s188_1-s188_21.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they did n't learn
1561	sw02549_s235_2-s235_32.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i uh i went to purdue university for a couple of years and uh really learned to hate indianapolis while i was out there
1562	sw02956_s94_3-s94_60.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	to if you if you go on the attack i and put some sensational thing before the public as mike <unk> learned in the last campaign and it is not refuted people will you know uh believe it
1563	sw03169_s52_1-s52_19.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to
1564	sw02826_s168_1-s168_19.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	uh she learned to drive i think when i was um a teenager
1565	sw02617_s119_1-s119_10.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	but uh i do think we learned
1566	sw02860_s77_1-s77_6.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and of course we learned too
1567	sw02617_s66_1-s66_12.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	uh i think we learned too much of the effects
1568	sw03152_s225_1-s225_10.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i <unk> learned a lot about playing the piano
1569	sw02653_s27_1-s27_11.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	but you know i never really learned to operate one
1570	sw02611_s125_1-s125_15.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	but now i <unk> i <unk> learned how to sew
1571	sw03045_s76_3-s76_16.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i learned i i learned <unk> uh
1572	sw03045_s76_3-s76_16.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i learned i i learned <unk> uh
1573	sw03083_s26_1-s26_36.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	you <unk> going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home
1574	sw03811_s71_1-s71_13.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and and that s really what we <unk> learned about it
1575	sw02316_s35_1-s35_3.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	what we learned
1576	sw02324_s76_1-s76_50.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	even when i was in elementary school years ago they were you know we learned what a centimeter was and a <unk> and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements things like that
1577	sw03476_s99_1-s99_12.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i mean i think my children learned the metric system
1578	sw02382_s227_1-s227_4.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i learned something here
1579	sw02617_s114_1-s114_22.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	so i i i do think that we <unk> learned from it
1580	sw02611_s161_1-s161_14.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know
1581	sw02539_s197_1-s197_33.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	so <unk> i feel that i learned a great deal from my students uh with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents
1582	sw03045_s79_1-s79_8.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and so i learned that on there too
1583	sw03206_s35_1-s35_44.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	that s one thing that i have learned in <unk> working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you do n't really know what they <unk> like
1584	sw03045_s72_1-s72_6.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and i learned <unk> on that
1585	sw02724_s64_1-s64_30.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	so once i got into this uh <unk> i learned all the physiological <unk> <unk> advantages to it
1586	sw02617_s35_1-s35_13.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and i i think that we learned from that
1587	sw02109_s61_1-s61_36.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman
1588	sw03525_s87_1-s87_10.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	i have n't learned to hit the ball easy
1589	sw02818_s112_1-s112_14.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older
1590	sw03781_s35_1-s35_6.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	so my mother learned from that
1591	sw02653_s26_1-s26_10.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	so uh i learned to repair one
1592	sw02724_s59_1-s59_11.TextGrid	learned	learned_vrb	and i learned all the health benefits of you know
1593	sw03763_s101_1-s101_19.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead
1594	sw03811_s105_1-s105_62.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	i think that uh my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that s a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn
1595	sw02253_s69_1-s69_34.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	it s a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that lead to the events that brought about the civil war
1596	sw04114_s63_1-s63_51.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	i guess right now what they <unk> what they <unk> primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess united states and and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production
1597	sw03763_s99_1-s99_43.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	you know it s too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the rangers you know
1598	sw02784_s21_1-s21_109.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	why i i m i m a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and and easy i do n't know i should n't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh <unk> uh uh over the uh <unk> uh might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe
1599	sw03294_s110_1-s110_21.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	well and sometimes that s this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
1600	sw04342_s77_3-s77_42.TextGrid	lead	lead_nou-vrb	but uh a and occasionally i i pick up like time magazine or something i think uh if they <unk> got an interesting lead story
1601	sw02279_s225_1-s225_7.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	and they live at home you know
1602	sw03134_s158_1-s158_10.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	and uh they live in peoria illinois

1605	sw02316_s3_1-s3_28.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
1606	sw02316_s3_1-s3_28.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
1607	sw03313_s89_1-s89_24.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	but it s that not getting involved that impersonal society i think we live in today
1608	sw03443_s189_1-s189_20.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	well uh i do n't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto

1666	sw03067_s169_1-s169_49.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	they had chosen santa barbara california for this summer and and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the texas oklahoma area

1690	sw04151_s1_1-s1_34.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	do you ever think that there s a crime that s just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just does n't deserve to live anymore
1691	sw02691_s128_1-s128_4.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	they live in <unk>
1692	sw02790_s49_1-s49_43.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	but realistically that s i m i m realizing that s probably not going to be possible um for middle class people to be able to live just on one income
1693	sw04366_s17_1-s17_16.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him

1706	sw02860_s149_1-s149_40.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	uh but it has been um it s been interesting and particularly i i think because the society in which we live families are separated
1707	sw02910_s6_1-s6_23.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	i live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime

1720	sw03201_s38_1-s38_25.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary
1721	sw03317_s2_1-s2_8.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	what kind of house do you live in
1722	sw03045_s6_1-s6_8.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	and they live just about three miles away

1776	sw04346_s16_1-s16_23.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	but i do live in the better well in the best part of the city though
1777	sw03902_s35_1-s35_11.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
1778	sw02866_s258_2-s258_27.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	it s it s so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective
1779	sw02285_s99_1-s99_20.TextGrid	live	live_vrb	you do n't have to live on the you know for a street life

1990	sw02290_s198_1-s198_7.TextGrid	mouth	mouth_nou	and it has a huge strong mouth
1991	sw02397_s254_1-s254_13.TextGrid	mouth	mouth_nou	and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth

1995	sw03073_s224_1-s224_39.TextGrid	mouth	mouth_nou	and he walked around the house with his <unk> face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he would n't let anybody pull it
1996	sw02395_s145_1-s145_38.TextGrid	mouth	mouth_nou	and friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
1997	sw02260_s85_1-s85_48.TextGrid	mouth	mouth_nou	so you know even even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh jesus said the money in the fish s mouth or in the fisher inside the fish
1998	sw04691_s17_1-s17_40.TextGrid	mouth	mouth_nou	and he always had this uh this wonderful quality of c being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
1999	sw02092_s18_1-s18_70.TextGrid	moderate	moderate_adj-nou	but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it s like i ca n't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars um you know three times a week
2000	sw04659_s36_1-s36_14.TextGrid	minute	minute	because you <unk> expected to work on stuff up until the last minute
2001	sw02397_s35_1-s35_6.TextGrid	minute	minute	but the minute marks are done
2002	sw02157_s142_1-s142_11.TextGrid	minute	minute	they always say you <unk> talked your ten minute limit
2003	sw02650_s315_1-s315_12.TextGrid	minute	minute	it s like wait a minute you know
2004	sw03069_s117_2-s117_4.TextGrid	minute	minute	wait a minute
2005	sw02619_s24_1-s24_23.TextGrid	minute	minute	and i think that s what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute
2006	sw03830_s9_1-s9_10.TextGrid	minute	minute	can i run a minute and shut my radio off
2007	sw03750_s100_1-s100_10.TextGrid	minute	minute	so it is a forty five minute drive to the mountains
2008	sw02260_s299_1-s299_11.TextGrid	minute	minute	they <unk> are going to interrupt us any minute now
2009	sw03317_s129_1-s129_20.TextGrid	minute	minute	so you <unk> all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute
2010	sw03236_s86_1-s86_12.TextGrid	minute	minute	but we can do our part take an extra minute or two
2011	sw03069_s119_2-s119_4.TextGrid	minute	minute	wait a minute
2012	sw02667_s142_1-s142_15.TextGrid	minute	minute	but at to me it s every minute s agony
2013	sw02395_s56_1-s56_27.TextGrid	minute	minute	but they they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories
2014	sw02187_s180_1-s180_10.TextGrid	minute	minute	i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds
2015	sw03443_s114_2-s114_5.TextGrid	minute	minute	hang on a minute
2016	sw02826_s186_1-s186_12.TextGrid	minute	minute	it s not so much that they come to you every minute
2017	sw03728_s159_1-s159_8.TextGrid	minute	minute	so like that took like a minute
2018	sw02397_s34_1-s34_5.TextGrid	minute	minute	i guess the minute marks
2019	sw02252_s21_1-s21_30.TextGrid	minute	minute	the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know
2020	sw02163_s3_1-s3_12.TextGrid	minute	minute	i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
2021	sw02316_s149_1-s149_45.TextGrid	minute	minute	like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you <unk> getting raises every eighteen months you got to go now hey wait a minute

2023	sw02818_s219_1-s219_8.TextGrid	minute	minute	that s like world war three every minute
2024	sw02372_s190_1-s190_9.TextGrid	minute	minute	i was going oh wait a minute
2025	sw02397_s31_2-s31_25.TextGrid	minute	minute	was was the whole face done or just the numbers and and like minute marks
2026	sw02252_s165_1-s165_38.TextGrid	minute	minute	it s kind of a strange thing we <unk> been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute
2027	sw03315_s27_1-s27_3.TextGrid	minute	minute	just a minute
2028	sw02792_s81_2-s81_20.TextGrid	minute	minute	i if i have a minute that s what i i do
2029	sw03235_s17_1-s17_16.TextGrid	minute	minute	and i would n't trade change a minute of it for anything
2030	sw02275_s161_1-s161_18.TextGrid	minute	minute	the minute they get married everything s supposed to be cut and dried
2031	sw03085_s207_1-s207_21.TextGrid	minute	minute	and i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what s happening
2032	sw02772_s28_1-s28_29.TextGrid	minute	minute	and if you go just a little bit ways in i d say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas uh the weather completely changes
2033	sw04890_s78_2-s78_13.TextGrid	minute	minute	and so and i say well wait a minute
2034	sw03425_s20_1-s20_13.TextGrid	minute	minute	but uh it s about a thirty minute exercise every morning
2035	sw03069_s118_2-s118_4.TextGrid	minute	minute	wait a minute
2036	sw02362_s82_1-s82_9.TextGrid	minute	minute	and i did n't believe it for a minute
2037	sw03515_s25_1-s25_16.TextGrid	minute	minute	oh can you can you hold on for just a minute
2038	sw03075_s137_1-s137_25.TextGrid	minute	minute	the minute i said the word he he he s <unk> at the bit
2039	sw03411_s107_1-s107_19.TextGrid	minute	minute	it s a had not had one minute s problem with it
2040	sw02275_s138_1-s138_51.TextGrid	minute	minute	but it s it s always been a formula uh for t v that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up you know dying
2041	sw04659_s30_1-s30_44.TextGrid	minute	minute	and now it s the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine
2042	sw02445_s136_1-s136_33.TextGrid	minute	minute	but the minute the sun went down um that s when it s usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
2043	sw02445_s136_1-s136_33.TextGrid	minute	minute	but the minute the sun went down um that s when it s usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
2044	sw03023_s30_1-s30_16.TextGrid	minute	minute	now just to focus on that a minute i guess uh uh
2045	sw02372_s151_1-s151_47.TextGrid	minute	minute	so they just want black and white which <unk> see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
2046	sw03099_s71_1-s71_30.TextGrid	mobile	mobile_nou-art	and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
2047	sw03809_s78_1-s78_31.TextGrid	mobile	mobile	and if they <unk> out there buying that many cars then there s that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working
2048	sw02868_s135_1-s135_39.TextGrid	mobile	mobile	i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe you know like a a small camper
2049	sw02956_s52_1-s52_13.TextGrid	mobile	mobile	and we <unk> the mobile mobile society uh
2050	sw02956_s52_1-s52_13.TextGrid	mobile	mobile	and we <unk> the mobile mobile society uh
2051	sw03237_s207_2-s207_17.TextGrid	mobile	mobile	we at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
2096	sw02259_s4_1-s4_41.TextGrid	permit	permit_vrb	um i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern europe for example uh particularly the uh the jewish uh uh people from russia
2097	sw02259_s5_1-s5_24.TextGrid	permit	permit_vrb	i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last uh several years
2098	sw02259_s43_1-s43_84.TextGrid	permit	permit_vrb	well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country uh i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um some quotas
2099	sw02252_s141_1-s141_16.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	well i guess like with uh israel is a perfect example
2100	sw02435_s269_1-s269_8.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	it was just too perfect at all times
2101	sw02826_s153_1-s153_19.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	uh not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago
2102	sw04340_s82_2-s82_21.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
2103	sw02229_s228_1-s228_7.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	not everybody has a picture perfect body
2104	sw03491_s22_1-s22_7.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	the lines in there were just perfect
2105	sw03345_s144_1-s144_4.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	uh nothing is perfect
2106	sw02759_s168_1-s168_32.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	so i guess if they perfect that <unk> is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
2107	sw04340_s81_1-s81_17.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	you do the best you can to make it perfect you know
2108	sw02539_s124_2-s124_30.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	i uh i found that uh it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
2109	sw03296_s83_1-s83_6.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	we use word perfect lotus
2110	sw03144_s158_1-s158_45.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	and uh i m holding out for city slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it s just perfect for our age group

2113	sw02111_s127_2-s127_31.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes when you know these are perfect
2114	sw03171_s94_1-s94_4.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	so that s perfect
2115	sw02041_s225_1-s225_7.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	they do n't have that perfect look
2116	sw03215_s3_1-s3_17.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	um as i was sitting there i thought the weather s been perfect
2117	sw02111_s142_1-s142_10.TextGrid	perfect	perfect_adj	those are perfect boxes to put files in

2147	sw02896_s165_1-s165_11.TextGrid	project	project_nou	oh well i hope your project turns out great
2148	sw03236_s109_1-s109_9.TextGrid	project	project_nou	well that sounds like a pretty good project
2149	sw04026_s101_2-s101_25.TextGrid	project	project_nou	and but we do test after during the assembly project product um
2150	sw04886_s18_1-s18_25.TextGrid	project	project_nou	maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing
2151	sw04785_s82_2-s82_37.TextGrid	project	project_nou	and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too or whatever
2152	sw03096_s240_1-s240_24.TextGrid	project	project_nou	and uh uh so we are doing it to raise money for uh a large project at church
2153	sw04603_s11_1-s11_20.TextGrid	project	project_nou	and you have to do a public service project uh in which leadership is the key element
2154	sw02469_s87_1-s87_13.TextGrid	project	project_nou	the first project i started out one was a big one
2155	sw03776_s35_1-s35_35.TextGrid	progress	progress_nou	uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster
2156	sw03085_s186_1-s186_11.TextGrid	progress	progress_nou	and i was very pleased with their development and their progress
2157	sw02229_s117_1-s117_29.TextGrid	progress	progress_nou	we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
2158	sw03096_s197_2-s197_33.TextGrid	progress	progress_nou	having a daughter who has gone into this into engineering i sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than i did
2159	sw03096_s202_1-s202_14.TextGrid	progress	progress_nou	so that s that s progress i guess
2160	sw03135_s166_1-s166_17.TextGrid	progress	progress_nou	but i think we <unk> finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
2161	sw02828_s113_1-s113_68.TextGrid	produce	produce_vrb	well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of of say a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for uh <unk> that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in texas and california
2162	sw02828_s139_1-s139_63.TextGrid	produce	produce_vrb	and i hope maybe we <unk> going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh reagan s uh new education secretary and uh you know trying to do some uh trying to produce some new programs anyway
2163	sw02010_s100_2-s100_65.TextGrid	produce	produce_vrb	the the difficulty with with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good
2164	sw02451_s66_1-s66_42.TextGrid	produce	produce_vrb	what s bad for the soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should
2165	sw03784_s54_1-s54_12.TextGrid	produce	produce_vrb	and if he ca n't produce evidence not argument but evidence
2166	sw04796_s72_1-s72_51.TextGrid	produce	produce_vrb	the only commitments that they <unk> interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to mars which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth
2167	sw04096_s57_1-s57_20.TextGrid	produce	produce_vrb	but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
2168	sw03382_s95_1-s95_23.TextGrid	progress	progress_vrb	i think that s what made us uh progress to the state we are is our curiosity
2169	sw03088_s154_1-s154_29.TextGrid	protest	protest_vrb	and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they <unk> really concerned about their rights or whether they <unk> really concerned about something else
2170	sw03088_s127_1-s127_44.TextGrid	protest	protest_vrb	and the city workers uh took them to court to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first a the the search and seizure amendment
2171	sw03168_s33_1-s33_13.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	and we at the present time do not have random testing
2172	sw04372_s34_1-s34_11.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	which is exactly what businesses do at the present
2173	sw03159_s61_1-s61_24.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what uh pertains to my daily life at the present time
2174	sw02860_s234_1-s234_5.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	and you buy a present
2175	sw02092_s143_1-s143_24.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	i told him <unk> if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a <unk>
2176	sw02962_s32_1-s32_10.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh prevail
2177	sw04908_s14_1-s14_31.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	of course uh you being from new mexico you <unk> probably been n to washington especially if you <unk> your present location
2178	sw04688_s84_1-s84_57.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than most people probably <unk> might be in terms of keeping keeping score of input and output
2179	sw03090_s56_2-s56_18.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	but then so i took the ones from fifty two on to the present
2180	sw04688_s7_1-s7_72.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	you know so uh the only thing we <unk> you know that we do now is uh i keep a a little spread sheet of uh what i call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth
2181	sw02589_s64_1-s64_21.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	and then we have to take another one that s mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present
2182	sw02372_s210_1-s210_30.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	how are we supposed to present the imagine that we <unk> supposed to present with equipment that s outdated that s obsolete
2183	sw04688_s82_1-s82_16.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	uh it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present
2184	sw02503_s54_1-s54_17.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home
2185	sw02860_s245_1-s245_10.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	well it was the equivalent of a christmas present
2186	sw04682_s53_1-s53_14.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
2187	sw03049_s95_1-s95_37.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	now i was warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a uh witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time
2188	sw02877_s36_1-s36_9.TextGrid	present	present_adj-nou	well at the present time i have two dogs
2189	sw02187_s123_1-s123_20.TextGrid	produce	produce_nou	a lot of um of a um winter produce comes from south america
2190	sw02488_s126_1-s126_7.TextGrid	protest	protest_nou	and there was a lot of protest
2191	sw02442_s94_1-s94_16.TextGrid	rebel	rebel_vrb	if i feel too obligated to do it i start to rebel
2192	sw02597_s104_1-s104_17.TextGrid	rebel	rebel_vrb	but you see president bush is telling them rebel you know uh uprise
2193	sw04049_s9_1-s9_21.TextGrid	reject	reject_vrb	do you think it s okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they <unk> take drugs
2194	sw02611_s218_1-s218_19.TextGrid	reject	reject_vrb	and uh places like j c penney s that they <unk> reject the seconds
2195	sw04565_s20_1-s20_10.TextGrid	refuse	refuse_vrb	so i refuse to have one in the house
2196	sw04364_s33_1-s33_4.TextGrid	refuse	refuse_vrb	you can always refuse
2197	sw03134_s90_1-s90_40.TextGrid	refuse	refuse_vrb	now if they do n't i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them
2198	sw03821_s149_1-s149_4.TextGrid	refuse	refuse_vrb	and i just refuse
2199	sw04364_s15_1-s15_16.TextGrid	refuse	refuse_vrb	once i found out that that s really not necessary or legal then i just refuse
2200	sw02032_s176_1-s176_28.TextGrid	record	record_vrb	and now you <unk> singing all this stuff that does n't matter what you what you sing or what you record
2201	sw02439_s121_1-s121_15.TextGrid	record	record_vrb	i did n't want to interfere with whatever they <unk> trying to record
2202	sw03962_s92_1-s92_4.TextGrid	record	record_vrb	and they record it
2203	sw03073_s66_1-s66_20.TextGrid	record	record_vrb	sometimes it s better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one
2204	sw02876_s44_1-s44_51.TextGrid	refuse	refuse_nou	but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh a bend that we put things in for <unk> these other things
2205	sw02249_s147_1-s147_20.TextGrid	refuse	refuse_nou	and uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse
2206	sw02253_s93_1-s93_23.TextGrid	rebel	rebel_nou	my husband is always you know talked about texas being a uh rebel state

2311	sw03830_s129_1-s129_10.TextGrid	read	read_past	i just read this in the paper the other day

2317	sw02703_s114_1-s114_26.TextGrid	read	read_past	when i read it i should have realized that because i mean it had foster s style written all over it
2318	sw02154_s54_1-s54_73.TextGrid	read	read_past	well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with
2319	sw03408_s28_1-s28_8.TextGrid	read	read_past	you know i read a study once

2322	sw04342_s38_2-s38_27.TextGrid	read	read_past	i uh fact last time i read the dallas dallas news i was in arkansas
2323	sw02275_s81_1-s81_54.TextGrid	read	read_past	well but see i read an article about in t v guide about uh about hunter and about his you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them
2324	sw03069_s167_1-s167_5.TextGrid	read	read_past	well i read that
2325	sw03595_s172_1-s172_9.TextGrid	read	read_past	do you know anyone that s read it
2326	sw02253_s45_1-s45_77.TextGrid	read	read_past	and uh the last uh i m embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i can not right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the <unk> uh lone star or the the texas history book
2327	sw03300_s30_1-s30_7.TextGrid	read	read_past	and i read the book from that
2328	sw02648_s137_1-s137_41.TextGrid	read	read_past	and i read in this article i could n't believe it where you know like one cow produces like a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure
2329	sw03069_s140_1-s140_23.TextGrid	read	read_past	but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i had n't read something before then
2330	sw03067_s179_1-s179_18.TextGrid	read	read_past	you have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth
2331	sw02910_s9_1-s9_12.TextGrid	read	read_past	i <unk> always read the new york times when i was younger
2332	sw03041_s112_1-s112_39.TextGrid	read	read_past	um and i only bring up wounded knee because that was what ten years ago you read and and understood you know about the american pop indian population
2333	sw03069_s103_1-s103_15.TextGrid	read	read_past	but that s the last thing i i <unk> read
2334	sw02253_s240_1-s240_26.TextGrid	read	read_past	and i think that s probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that i <unk> ever read
2335	sw02466_s22_1-s22_30.TextGrid	read	read_past	and now i <unk> like a said i <unk> read a lot of self self help books
2336	sw03595_s84_1-s84_16.TextGrid	read	read_past	and i took a novel with me uh and read it at thanksgiving time
2337	sw02499_s109_1-s109_7.TextGrid	read	read_past	well i had n't read it
2338	sw03056_s101_1-s101_16.TextGrid	read	read_past	well i i guess i just have not read <unk>
2339	sw02669_s71_1-s71_7.TextGrid	read	read_past	i read that what uganda and
2340	sw04033_s75_1-s75_37.TextGrid	read	read_past	of course during the <unk> when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on
2341	sw02717_s74_1-s74_25.TextGrid	record	record_nou	but i mean uh baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year
2342	sw03962_s111_1-s111_5.TextGrid	record	record_nou	he got a bonus record
2343	sw04080_s112_1-s112_23.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and then they check you out and make sure you do n't have a record you know and things like that
2344	sw04611_s48_2-s48_13.TextGrid	record	record_nou	let me ask by the way just for the record
2345	sw04370_s50_1-s50_57.TextGrid	record	record_nou	matter of fact i <unk> heard that i <unk> heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
2346	sw02028_s16_1-s16_6.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and we set a record yesterday
2347	sw03090_s31_1-s31_30.TextGrid	record	record_nou	so i think it is probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record
2348	sw04834_s68_1-s68_23.TextGrid	record	record_nou	uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to
2349	sw03090_s46_1-s46_26.TextGrid	record	record_nou	since i have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess i can go back and look
2350	sw03796_s20_1-s20_40.TextGrid	record	record_nou	one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an n b a record for seventy wins in a season
2351	sw04127_s51_1-s51_29.TextGrid	record	record_nou	actually i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it s a record of everything
2352	sw02640_s39_1-s39_7.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and he s got this clean record
2353	sw02749_s65_1-s65_10.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and they said the record showed i served
2354	sw03596_s25_1-s25_87.TextGrid	record	record_nou	well actually i m i m i <unk> heard on the news that we uh will be setting a record here in the state of texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture we <unk> had this year that it s going to break all kind of records that were set set set back since nineteen thirty two
2355	sw02131_s271_1-s271_36.TextGrid	record	record_nou	well the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle
2356	sw02027_s41_1-s41_32.TextGrid	record	record_nou	when uh i was at t i the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes
2357	sw03021_s78_1-s78_33.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
2358	sw02559_s59_1-s59_29.TextGrid	record	record_nou	but um i guess we <unk> changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody s record
2359	sw02314_s93_1-s93_33.TextGrid	record	record_nou	the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company
2360	sw02032_s163_1-s163_26.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like no jacket required
2361	sw02131_s277_1-s277_36.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and you see seventy <unk> a a lot at at the stores a a at record stores
2362	sw02314_s18_1-s18_65.TextGrid	record	record_nou	i think your record should stand for itself that you know if you <unk> been tested at other companies and you <unk> always come up negative or whatever then i do n't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over
2363	sw02490_s27_1-s27_14.TextGrid	record	record_nou	i think there s a check for <unk> felonies on your record
2364	sw02330_s52_1-s52_38.TextGrid	record	record_nou	um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
2365	sw02032_s138_2-s138_11.TextGrid	record	record_nou	that that whole record was pretty good
2366	sw03090_s78_1-s78_30.TextGrid	record	record_nou	i found a record that i had i travel in europe a lot and i what i had paid for hotels
2367	sw03445_s103_1-s103_14.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there
2368	sw02858_s26_1-s26_10.TextGrid	record	record_nou	he s a record collector and a hot wheels collector
2369	sw02027_s58_1-s58_23.TextGrid	record	record_nou	and you know this area where record retention is there s only a few people that work there
2370	sw02645_s20_1-s20_8.TextGrid	resume	resume_nou	i think it will become resume writing
2371	sw03045_s34_1-s34_27.TextGrid	resume	resume_nou	um my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things uh his resume his uh letter
2372	sw03068_s135_1-s135_14.TextGrid	resume	resume_nou	though i would put it on my resume what program i went to
2373	sw02423_s98_1-s98_19.TextGrid	resume	resume_nou	i m just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at digital
2374	sw04071_s34_2-s34_11.TextGrid	refund	refund_nou	nice nice to get a refund

2378	sw03983_s96_2-s96_11.TextGrid	read	read_present	but but i do read it too
2379	sw04123_s42_2-s42_39.TextGrid	read	read_present	but uh and when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
2380	sw02065_s173_1-s173_52.TextGrid	read	read_present	she started some type of um national organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards you know helpful things
2381	sw03056_s98_1-s98_15.TextGrid	read	read_present	and uh i like to read a novel every now and then
2382	sw03458_s111_1-s111_31.TextGrid	read	read_present	if i read three articles in in you know one of the journals i figure you know i did really well
2383	sw02962_s73_1-s73_14.TextGrid	read	read_present	because i guess everywhere i read that there is a shortage of judges
2384	sw02060_s74_1-s74_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	well what newspapers uh do you read in dallas
2385	sw02792_s151_1-s151_45.TextGrid	read	read_present	and um i i like to uh read about people who have been a successful you know who who made a success of their lives
2386	sw04565_s71_1-s71_8.TextGrid	read	read_present	uh but i read you know
2387	sw02226_s34_2-s34_41.TextGrid	read	read_present	and it and it s kind of short because we do n't woe do n't have a lot of time to to read
2388	sw04022_s42_2-s42_7.TextGrid	read	read_present	read my lips or whatever
2389	sw02253_s2_1-s2_23.TextGrid	read	read_present	the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh uh i guess
2390	sw03300_s95_2-s95_16.TextGrid	read	read_present	i like i like to read some of the philosophy stuff
2391	sw02226_s11_1-s11_48.TextGrid	read	read_present	but it seems as though if you really want to set a t side time to read the bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
2392	sw02039_s114_1-s114_17.TextGrid	read	read_present	i read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff
2393	sw04733_s82_1-s82_12.TextGrid	read	read_present	and if you read national surveys they <unk> far from it
2394	sw04033_s60_1-s60_9.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i guess i do read that
2395	sw02466_s9_1-s9_10.TextGrid	read	read_present	so sounds like you like to read
2396	sw03658_s12_1-s12_16.TextGrid	read	read_present	did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject
2397	sw03300_s11_1-s11_19.TextGrid	read	read_present	i read uh a lot of steven king dean r koontz uh some danielle steel
2398	sw03309_s25_1-s25_17.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i read you know how our politicians voted each week in the paper

2402	sw04082_s3_1-s3_17.TextGrid	read	read_present	and sometimes i <unk> read like the uh wall street or the new york times
2403	sw02253_s3_1-s3_7.TextGrid	read	read_present	oh i just read for escape

2406	sw02703_s333_1-s333_8.TextGrid	read	read_present	but you do n't read many sports books
2407	sw03551_s99_1-s99_53.TextGrid	read	read_present	but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write
2408	sw03809_s34_1-s34_39.TextGrid	read	read_present	every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you <unk> see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men
2409	sw03300_s114_1-s114_9.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i like to read stuff like that

2414	sw04611_s22_1-s22_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i occasionally will read something like the new york review of books
2415	sw02466_s165_1-s165_15.TextGrid	read	read_present	so i keep getting stacks of books i need to read
2416	sw02836_s206_1-s206_19.TextGrid	read	read_present	so you know people who do n't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
2417	sw03551_s100_1-s100_20.TextGrid	read	read_present	because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know
2418	sw02466_s82_1-s82_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	my oldest daughter had to read lost horizons for her english class

2423	sw03159_s22_1-s22_22.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i found that i really did n't have time at home since i work to read them
2424	sw03333_s107_1-s107_16.TextGrid	read	read_present	but now you know you would n't probably read about it here in texas
2425	sw02619_s40_1-s40_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	you just say well look read the miles per hour one

2531	sw04380_s48_2-s48_33.TextGrid	read	read_present	but uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read
2532	sw02466_s175_1-s175_7.TextGrid	read	read_present	do you like to read mysteries
2533	sw03069_s147_1-s147_28.TextGrid	read	read_present	and then when jennie had to read it at gettysburg and i got her the i got her someone
2534	sw02910_s73_1-s73_3.TextGrid	read	read_present	do you read

2548	sw03300_s86_1-s86_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	and that s what made me want to read the book
2549	sw02226_s61_1-s61_22.TextGrid	read	read_present	because uh i love to read his his uh children s books just
2550	sw02253_s43_1-s43_24.TextGrid	read	read_present	i read an awful lot of uh periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference books

2552	sw03130_s143_1-s143_24.TextGrid	read	read_present	and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know
2553	sw04345_s58_2-s58_55.TextGrid	read	read_present	they they want to sit down in front of the <unk> and uh or at a read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every

2557	sw03159_s11_1-s11_25.TextGrid	read	read_present	and uh i read magazines mainly because they <unk> fast and if i want to relax while i watch t v

2560	sw04177_s27_1-s27_45.TextGrid	read	read_present	and for the longer term i i read uh like scientific american and and uh readers digest and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they
2561	sw02703_s53_1-s53_17.TextGrid	read	read_present	and it was like uh i want to read something else for a while

2567	sw03458_s106_1-s106_58.TextGrid	read	read_present	otherwise if if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf i <unk> pick it up then rather than having them delivered and think oh i really need to read this
2568	sw02792_s302_1-s302_11.TextGrid	read	read_present	i m not saying they read all the right things
2569	sw03551_s91_2-s91_39.TextGrid	read	read_present	that s that s pretty low that there s forty eight countries ahead of us that have more <unk> more citizens percentage wise that can read and write
2570	sw04082_s11_1-s11_14.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i read the front page of the wall street journal most every day
2571	sw03354_s146_1-s146_50.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i said you know you need to either read neal sperry s book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there
2572	sw02554_s150_1-s150_25.TextGrid	read	read_present	you know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert
2573	sw03056_s159_1-s159_22.TextGrid	read	read_present	but uh i have got a lot of books that i i intend to read
2574	sw03345_s26_1-s26_5.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i read the newspaper
2575	sw03728_s23_1-s23_16.TextGrid	read	read_present	and so i often drop in on a break and and read it
2576	sw02466_s21_1-s21_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	i used to read just mainly <unk> fiction
2577	sw02383_s6_1-s6_33.TextGrid	read	read_present	i do see a problem with graduating people that that ca n't read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves
2578	sw02113_s51_1-s51_16.TextGrid	read	read_present	i did n't read see the the movie

2582	sw02253_s45_1-s45_77.TextGrid	read	read_present	and uh the last uh i m embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i can not right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the <unk> uh lone star or the the texas history book

2585	sw02226_s307_1-s307_19.TextGrid	read	read_present	so it s it s hard for me to sit down and read
2586	sw02866_s13_1-s13_31.TextGrid	read	read_present	and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just i m reading so much all the time
2587	sw04611_s28_1-s28_47.TextGrid	read	read_present	and anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always so uh covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i do n't have much confidence in it
2588	sw02910_s12_4-s12_45.TextGrid	read	read_present	i also read uh i i i guess i do watch uh <unk> <unk> on p b s because i i lean to that coverage
2589	sw03309_s75_1-s75_33.TextGrid	read	read_present	well did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the teach the administrators pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers

2593	sw02226_s302_1-s302_14.TextGrid	read	read_present	a lot of people just do n't have time to read nowadays

2602	sw03595_s97_1-s97_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	because i i just live to read
2603	sw02154_s6_1-s6_13.TextGrid	read	read_present	i do n't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday
2604	sw02441_s153_1-s153_7.TextGrid	read	read_present	one in five americans ca n't read
2605	sw03023_s50_2-s50_29.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i i was reading the other day about uh corpus christi texas which has the the highest
2606	sw04137_s3_1-s3_30.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new <unk>
2607	sw04565_s66_1-s66_9.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	oh you know reading is so good
2608	sw02466_s94_1-s94_17.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading
2609	sw04347_s34_1-s34_3.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was reading
2610	sw03056_s36_1-s36_23.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that
2611	sw02703_s50_1-s50_13.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i started reading and got about sixty pages into it
2612	sw03062_s35_1-s35_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	as a matter of fact he s reading on level
2613	sw02226_s11_1-s11_48.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but it seems as though if you really want to set a t side time to read the bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
2614	sw02782_s160_1-s160_56.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	well i was just reading an article in uh a north carolina <unk> paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities
2615	sw03041_s245_1-s245_13.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but i was interested in reading <unk> before i saw the movie
2616	sw03069_s235_1-s235_82.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	not only am am i <unk> reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisers for this um journal does n't have right now does n't have a really respected name um who s a uh a scholar on on music
2617	sw02469_s30_1-s30_9.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	you get so involved in what you <unk> reading
2618	sw02024_s96_1-s96_40.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that s what i m involved in a lot at work
2619	sw02024_s79_1-s79_12.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	here again it s it s casual reading
2620	sw02703_s41_1-s41_21.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i uh of course i do n't ever get around to reading them
2621	sw02792_s320_1-s320_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i think that that s why reading is so important
2622	sw02558_s36_1-s36_14.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	or farm work in world war one i remember uh reading about
2623	sw02460_s64_1-s64_17.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going to sign him
2624	sw03056_s5_2-s5_17.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i <unk> actually i am reading a couple of different books uh
2625	sw03069_s41_1-s41_13.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but gee i just do n't have much time for enjoyment reading
2626	sw02024_s3_1-s3_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading
2627	sw03041_s230_2-s230_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	reading the little words at the bottom of the screen
2628	sw02466_s85_1-s85_10.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	so i just finished reading that for enjoyment
2629	sw03508_s117_1-s117_16.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	so i do n't know why what that was reading it for
2630	sw02253_s237_1-s237_48.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten <unk> buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
2631	sw03056_s156_1-s156_22.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but looking through them
2632	sw03569_s50_1-s50_10.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	there s one that i m reading right now
2633	sw02226_s111_1-s111_5.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	that s good fun reading
2634	sw02362_s274_1-s274_24.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when some people first tried that
2635	sw02395_s25_1-s25_38.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning
2636	sw02226_s99_2-s99_10.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but but it is good reading
2637	sw03062_s34_1-s34_8.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	he did n't have a problem with reading
2638	sw02691_s93_1-s93_37.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was just reading an article uh that there were nineteen thousand properties available in texas uh for sale by the <unk> resolution trust <unk> corporation
2639	sw02253_s16_2-s16_15.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	it it s very a typical for my reading though
2640	sw02253_s167_1-s167_42.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that i <unk> really gotten into reading and i think this is because the kids are getting to me is science fiction
2641	sw02015_s18_1-s18_26.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they <unk> read probably a thousand times that day already
2642	sw04123_s43_1-s43_22.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but uh i mean they they say it s like the sixth grade reading level
2643	sw02469_s14_1-s14_39.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i d say reading is probably one of my biggest ones because it s the type of thing that you can you can do a little bit at a time whereas
2644	sw02910_s124_1-s124_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i spend a lot of time reading about these things
2645	sw02024_s5_1-s5_13.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide
2646	sw03458_s32_1-s32_7.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but it s nice light reading
2647	sw02724_s104_1-s104_18.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
2648	sw03458_s82_1-s82_20.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i just think uh you know it s it s light reading
2649	sw02566_s141_1-s141_12.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and she s already reading and writing and stuff like that
2650	sw02998_s16_1-s16_27.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	interestingly some of the information i <unk> been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary
2651	sw02078_s331_1-s331_7.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	well i was reading the book
2652	sw02554_s162_1-s162_8.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and we make experts by reading books
2653	sw02253_s239_1-s239_4.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	you <unk> reading dune
2654	sw04565_s67_2-s67_21.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i uh i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little
2655	sw02466_s195_1-s195_9.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and you kind of forget the fun of reading
2656	sw04133_s95_1-s95_18.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was reading through a book on uh <unk> human <unk> research
2657	sw02466_s60_1-s60_24.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	so a lot of the books i <unk> been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues
2658	sw02139_s176_1-s176_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i remember reading in the paper a few months back
2659	sw02792_s299_1-s299_18.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and uh i think they <unk> all developed kind of an interest in reading also
2660	sw03300_s65_1-s65_10.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i m reading the lion and the wind right now
2661	sw02078_s184_1-s184_13.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and all i do is teach reading all day long
2662	sw04103_s63_2-s63_34.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i m uh uh actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading <unk> digest
2663	sw02436_s144_1-s144_27.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but it s well it s kind of it s kind of like reading magazines any more
2664	sw02253_s234_1-s234_14.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and uh i was reading dune which seeming rather ironic
2665	sw02024_s31_1-s31_24.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	uh right now i m occasionally reading on a book about uh the mardi gras in new orleans and its history
2666	sw02792_s121_1-s121_27.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	if i start into something and i really enjoy what i m reading then i have a terrible time getting away from it too
2667	sw02792_s62_1-s62_21.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	um i do n't do as much reading like i say as i would like to
2668	sw02792_s97_1-s97_19.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	if i m really interested in what i m reading i mean hours can go by
2669	sw03056_s95_1-s95_8.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	that is what i have been reading
2670	sw03041_s227_1-s227_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i mean if you do n't mind reading subtitles
2671	sw02024_s81_1-s81_7.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and it s really excellent fast reading
2672	sw02305_s231_1-s231_6.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	they actually should do some reading
2673	sw02547_s214_1-s214_17.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the montgomery county public schools makes
2674	sw02051_s21_1-s21_32.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but um just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
2675	sw04785_s23_1-s23_28.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
2676	sw02645_s24_2-s24_16.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and and i m getting rather good at reading want ads
2677	sw03159_s56_1-s56_27.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but uh that s mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this
2678	sw02469_s27_1-s27_16.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing
2679	sw03069_s176_2-s176_16.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i m um i have just started reading a book
2680	sw02466_s71_2-s71_18.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	is is that just the only type of reading you <unk> been doing
2681	sw02157_s111_1-s111_34.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody
2682	sw02466_s74_2-s74_31.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	it s it s hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment
2683	sw02466_s74_2-s74_31.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	it s it s hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment
2684	sw03467_s198_1-s198_8.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was reading that in the supermarket line
2685	sw02466_s75_1-s75_3.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	just joy reading
2686	sw02466_s14_1-s14_6.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but i have always loved reading
2687	sw02469_s11_1-s11_13.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it
2688	sw02866_s13_1-s13_31.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just i m reading so much all the time
2689	sw03069_s175_1-s175_15.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and that s about it because otherwise i m reading so much for school
2690	sw03551_s42_1-s42_20.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and uh one thing they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing
2691	sw03551_s107_1-s107_28.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and um they say that the average english student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago
2692	sw02226_s31_1-s31_8.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	so i like reading those to her
2693	sw03056_s99_1-s99_19.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	but uh i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
2694	sw02466_s19_1-s19_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	that what i <unk> been reading lately a lot of
2695	sw03159_s32_1-s32_16.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know different ones
2696	sw04347_s36_1-s36_19.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was reading something in uh consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact
2697	sw02145_s60_1-s60_58.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	uh i i do n't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the <unk> on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not
2698	sw04114_s52_1-s52_28.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	uh i was reading a an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that s going
2699	sw03159_s94_1-s94_19.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i tried uh reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it
2700	sw03551_s18_1-s18_31.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i d say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic in grade school
2701	sw02466_s171_1-s171_8.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	even if you took speed reading huh
2702	sw03491_s117_1-s117_12.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i uh was reading in uh a book
2703	sw03069_s149_1-s149_14.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i think it was um oh some actress reading it
2704	sw02469_s115_1-s115_6.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	i was reading when you called
2705	sw03056_s12_1-s12_11.TextGrid	reading	reading_en	and i have just now gotten around to reading it
2706	sw02571_s70_1-s70_22.TextGrid	row	row_1	and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth
2707	sw03369_s100_1-s100_8.TextGrid	row	row_1	and they showed all five in a row
2708	sw02157_s78_1-s78_10.TextGrid	row	row_1	and then they won five or six in a row
2709	sw02061_s223_1-s223_24.TextGrid	row	row_1	he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing
2710	sw02061_s223_1-s223_24.TextGrid	row	row_1	he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing
2711	sw02061_s223_1-s223_24.TextGrid	row	row_1	he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing
2712	sw04050_s95_1-s95_16.TextGrid	row	row_1	and i was n't very <unk> at that duty for two years in a row
2713	sw02546_s47_1-s47_57.TextGrid	row	row_1	you know that s that s no kind of deterrent because we we <unk> got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row
2714	sw02546_s47_1-s47_57.TextGrid	row	row_1	you know that s that s no kind of deterrent because we we <unk> got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row
2715	sw03369_s111_1-s111_40.TextGrid	row	row_1	and the thing that i did n't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row uh time wise they happen one after another and just no no time between them
2716	sw03525_s66_1-s66_12.TextGrid	row	row_1	and we play three days in a row three different courses
2717	sw02027_s49_1-s49_12.TextGrid	row	row_1	there was like a fan at the very end of the row
2718	sw02546_s70_1-s70_15.TextGrid	row	row_1	he s sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people
2719	sw02717_s25_1-s25_19.TextGrid	row	row_1	what s amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
2720	sw03389_s79_1-s79_20.TextGrid	row	row_1	when i was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the houston oilers
2721	sw04133_s78_1-s78_34.TextGrid	row	row_1	you know a a a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i <unk> seen
2722	sw02131_s216_1-s216_26.TextGrid	row	row_1	and i never have figured out how he won uh entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row
2723	sw02546_s66_1-s66_37.TextGrid	row	row_1	and the uh the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death you know he s been on death row for like eight years
2724	sw02427_s340_1-s340_16.TextGrid	row	row_1	and as a matter of fact i <unk> already done a second row of radishes
2725	sw02772_s80_1-s80_18.TextGrid	row	row_1	that s the second or third year in a row that we <unk> had a real rainy spring
2726	sw03503_s168_1-s168_8.TextGrid	row	row_1	they wo n't let you on death row
2727	sw03067_s144_1-s144_12.TextGrid	sake	sake	it s going just for the sake of getting together
2728	sw02785_s71_1-s71_4.TextGrid	sake	sake	for heaven s sake
2729	sw02041_s20_1-s20_12.TextGrid	sake	sake	i do n't very often do things for the sake of exercise
2730	sw02041_s31_1-s31_21.TextGrid	sake	sake	and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising s sake
2731	sw04572_s68_1-s68_52.TextGrid	subject	subject_vrb	but again to require you know such a test and <unk> and then to make make it <unk> is to subject them to to <unk> discriminatory practices and other things
2732	sw04880_s87_1-s87_19.TextGrid	subject	subject_vrb	so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
2733	sw03088_s69_1-s69_43.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	and i think that s the only reason i have a problem with it when there s no you know there s no reason to suspect someone you know
2734	sw03284_s55_1-s55_46.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	uh i suspect that the yeah that that that that s not the thing that they that they do n't feel it s open to them
2735	sw03417_s9_1-s9_79.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	uh i suspect i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that s the direction we should look
2736	sw02094_s76_1-s76_34.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	um so i suspect that that s one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators
2737	sw04618_s73_1-s73_34.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it
2738	sw02397_s77_2-s77_13.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect you i suspect you have
2739	sw02397_s77_2-s77_13.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect you i suspect you have
2740	sw04603_s35_1-s35_14.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either
2741	sw02062_s19_1-s19_10.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	and i suspect that that s probably true for everyone
2742	sw04796_s6_1-s6_32.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off
2743	sw03615_s38_1-s38_14.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part
2744	sw03925_s9_1-s9_8.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	well i suspect that it is possible
2745	sw02094_s84_1-s84_38.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect that the <unk> that there s going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it
2746	sw02397_s115_1-s115_33.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect they <unk> fairly simple because the one lady i <unk> seen i know that does it i <unk> never asked her any questions
2747	sw02094_s142_1-s142_17.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	well i suspect that we <unk> probably covered everything that we need to here
2748	sw02094_s140_1-s140_16.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	so i suspect that it s it s an ever growing problem
2749	sw04908_s1_1-s1_43.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers
2750	sw04329_s95_1-s95_18.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	uh there s too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff
2751	sw02111_s209_1-s209_17.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	but in uh in the paper one you have to separate
2752	sw04329_s20_1-s20_12.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	and you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum
2753	sw02111_s243_1-s243_2.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	separate them
2754	sw02672_s16_1-s16_12.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	and we have to separate our papers and our glass
2755	sw04153_s56_1-s56_9.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	you know they really did separate them well
2756	sw04908_s10_1-s10_17.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	they separate them as they as they you know dump them
2757	sw03201_s68_1-s68_16.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it
2758	sw02111_s236_1-s236_19.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	and that s real discouraging thinking you <unk> sitting there working to separate it
2759	sw04736_s28_1-s28_91.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	the law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous acts are done to uh to you know to get somebody into a a situation where they <unk> going to be guilty of of a crime
2760	sw02111_s220_1-s220_15.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know
2761	sw03156_s38_1-s38_17.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	i really do n't understand that part on what they <unk> told you to separate everything
2762	sw02264_s9_1-s9_31.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	and you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a <unk> you know which is a real pain
2763	sw03876_s35_1-s35_47.TextGrid	separate	separate_vrb	we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
2764	sw02290_s38_1-s38_30.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	and you know there s part either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have
2765	sw02187_s250_1-s250_9.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl
2766	sw03156_s37_1-s37_23.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	i m not sure all what we <unk> going to have to do whether we have three separate containers
2767	sw02372_s30_1-s30_10.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	but i m getting two separate <unk> machines also
2768	sw02111_s238_1-s238_19.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	and someone else is n't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags
2769	sw02184_s35_1-s35_14.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	and he went to a a separate drug testing firm
2770	sw03131_s82_1-s82_30.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	and uh you know the type of facilities whether it s a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom
2771	sw02397_s232_1-s232_7.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	and then i buy the bibs separate
2772	sw04329_s31_1-s31_23.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	the city brought ought you know set <unk> separate trash cans
2773	sw04379_s46_1-s46_9.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	like you have a separate account for that then
2774	sw04153_s47_2-s47_12.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	did did they separate them by age group
2775	sw04633_s28_1-s28_13.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters
2776	sw03154_s136_1-s136_18.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in
2777	sw03154_s138_1-s138_22.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	they have this day now that it s you know separate from the other trash pick up
2778	sw04051_s33_2-s33_16.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	and then how many a a freezer separate from
2779	sw02295_s74_1-s74_25.TextGrid	separate	separate_adj	but then if you deteriorate um they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time
2780	sw02571_s18_1-s18_13.TextGrid	sow	sow	but that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow
2781	sw02910_s151_1-s151_39.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess i i got to say if that s the subject if the subject is do i feel that we <unk> well enough equipped to
2782	sw02910_s151_1-s151_39.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess i i got to say if that s the subject if the subject is do i feel that we <unk> well enough equipped to
2783	sw02429_s92_1-s92_31.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
2784	sw04064_s90_1-s90_10.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	uh this is a little bit of the subject
2785	sw03467_s6_1-s6_10.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well anyway we <unk> got a easy subject
2786	sw03658_s12_1-s12_16.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject
2787	sw02073_s72_1-s72_34.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and uh it does n't matter who they put in office they <unk> going to fall subject to uh the pressure that the lobbyists can put
2788	sw03343_s2_1-s2_14.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	when they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank
2789	sw02650_s2_1-s2_24.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	this is really ironic that this would i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away
2790	sw03215_s1_1-s1_41.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well this is a subject that you never think you <unk> be assigned to one that kind of comes up when you <unk> lost it the others other subjects
2791	sw03159_s61_1-s61_24.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what uh pertains to my daily life at the present time
2792	sw02171_s20_1-s20_15.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but uh i do n't know how we got the subject <unk>
2793	sw03096_s1_1-s1_16.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well uh <unk> how do you view this whole subject
2794	sw02589_s40_2-s40_34.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject
2795	sw03331_s79_1-s79_10.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	so this is probably a real hard subject for you
2796	sw03309_s4_1-s4_11.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well it s kind of a broad subject uh
2797	sw02423_s119_1-s119_4.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	stick on the subject
2798	sw04152_s9_2-s9_53.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	lot of lot of interesting <unk> things i think would be a good be a good change if we <unk> going to be talking about the subject t tonight which in some i guess criminal courts the
2799	sw02708_s1_1-s1_17.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	anyway what are your what are your first comments on that subject
2800	sw03658_s7_1-s7_17.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	is that what you <unk> you <unk> thinking the subject is about
2801	sw03069_s297_1-s297_10.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but um this is not on the subject
2802	sw02407_s107_1-s107_27.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and i thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject
2803	sw02383_s15_1-s15_26.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and they ca n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line
2804	sw03205_s94_1-s94_22.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess we <unk> kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we
2805	sw02397_s2_1-s2_29.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	um i guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work
2806	sw03651_s2_1-s2_11.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess tonight s subject is uh woodworking
2807	sw02285_s5_1-s5_26.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	the subject is is big city crime which is something that i do n't have any first hand experiences about
2808	sw02559_s15_1-s15_5.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	that was the primary subject
2809	sw03159_s14_1-s14_14.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and i like them because they <unk> kind of short and to the subject
2810	sw03303_s82_1-s82_8.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but this was n't a good subject
2811	sw03229_s82_1-s82_5.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	it s a fun subject
2812	sw02295_s2_1-s2_21.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well on this subject i really had n't had to deal with putting someone in there yet
2813	sw02559_s1_1-s1_9.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well on this subject of invasion of privacy
2814	sw03658_s11_1-s11_10.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i think that s what the subject is about
2815	sw02429_s231_1-s231_13.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well i i think we <unk> covered the subject
2816	sw02065_s124_1-s124_14.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know
2817	sw02956_s1_1-s1_33.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well i i <unk> been uh i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject
2818	sw04707_s20_1-s20_20.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	uh i love the irony of uh talking about this subject on april the fifteenth
2819	sw03809_s107_1-s107_18.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject
2820	sw04340_s22_2-s22_25.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
2821	sw03809_s116_1-s116_20.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	you think about this when you come to when it comes to a subject like that
2822	sw02545_s10_1-s10_33.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	when this subject was mentioned to us i said well i went gee that s all i use mine for is a word <unk>
2823	sw04380_s97_1-s97_39.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	cause i wondered when they <unk> taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that
2824	sw02316_s185_1-s185_38.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	see this is n't a subject that i think a lot about because i m never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
2825	sw03103_s79_1-s79_17.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh nickie
2826	sw03103_s156_2-s156_28.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and uh but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is
2827	sw02599_s142_1-s142_26.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	boy speaking of denver on another subject i <unk> been up there like five times in the last three four weeks
2828	sw02558_s122_1-s122_24.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but whether it s something that they can put to to economic use later on is a different subject
2829	sw02065_s237_1-s237_8.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but any rate that s off the subject
2830	sw03443_s181_1-s181_13.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject
2831	sw03508_s141_1-s141_22.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	uh also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen
2832	sw02015_s49_1-s49_9.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i agree with you on that particular subject there
2833	sw02407_s38_1-s38_25.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	that s pretty interesting because just just because you know a subject matter does n't mean you can teach it
2834	sw02724_s148_1-s148_49.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	have you ever had a uh it s kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood <unk> done recently or since you <unk> been biking to see if it
2835	sw02060_s115_1-s115_11.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	boy current events is not a good subject for me
2836	sw03375_s56_1-s56_25.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	it seems that d be a subject that i i do n't have much to say on
2837	sw03417_s92_1-s92_10.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and that s that same subject
2838	sw02399_s148_1-s148_13.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject
2839	sw03375_s1_1-s1_24.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	uh well i i guess it s a subject i have n't thought too much about
2840	sw03159_s56_1-s56_27.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but uh that s mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this
2841	sw02719_s125_2-s125_11.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	let me ask you a question off the subject though
2842	sw02018_s13_1-s13_6.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	this is a different subject though
2843	sw03809_s2_1-s2_13.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	you probably uh more up on this subject than i am
2844	sw02932_s1_1-s1_9.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well carol since today s subject is our homes
2845	sw02397_s92_1-s92_11.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	how did you know to choose this subject tonight
2846	sw02302_s98_1-s98_7.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	but that s a whole different subject
2847	sw03449_s14_1-s14_13.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well do you have any uh opinion on the subject
2848	sw02640_s1_1-s1_24.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well i do n't i mean i do n't know what you think about the subject
2849	sw02018_s159_1-s159_13.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	you know when that subject comes up they can say yes
2850	sw02568_s192_1-s192_21.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	i mean it was what i liked about it was that it was a new subject
2851	sw02441_s293_1-s293_7.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well back to the original subject
2852	sw03317_s149_1-s149_7.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	here i m getting off the subject
2853	sw02407_s41_1-s41_38.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i do n't know if i d know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids
2854	sw03294_s134_2-s134_31.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed because it s subject to abuse
2855	sw02597_s1_1-s1_11.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	well this is a good subject is n't it
2856	sw02589_s44_1-s44_6.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	they need exposure to every subject
2857	sw02828_s123_1-s123_36.TextGrid	subject	subject_adj-nou	and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by texas then you had a built in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject
2858	sw02062_s52_1-s52_14.TextGrid	supplement	supplement_vrb	so i have to find a way to supplement that
2859	sw03130_s69_1-s69_23.TextGrid	supplement	supplement_vrb	and i was thinking you know maybe i d help supplement it you know when they turned them in
2860	sw02062_s37_1-s37_32.TextGrid	supplement	supplement_vrb	i think they have uh a one that we need to recognize that we <unk> going to have to supplement ourselves
2861	sw04890_s62_3-s62_23.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	and and so i but i i suspect a number of them
2862	sw04697_s74_1-s74_8.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	and i suspect it in cases like
2863	sw03056_s30_1-s30_10.TextGrid	suspect	suspect_vrb	he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect
2864	sw02832_s120_2-s120_16.TextGrid	tear	tear_vrb	it s it s seen some wear and tear you know
2865	sw02492_s142_1-s142_14.TextGrid	tear	tear_vrb	or it <unk> it <unk> tear up a nice tiller
2866	sw03467_s185_1-s185_38.TextGrid	tear	tear_vrb	there s never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers
2867	sw04886_s103_1-s103_9.TextGrid	tear	tear_vrb	you can always tear stuff out and <unk> it
2868	sw02421_s17_1-s17_29.TextGrid	transplant	transplant_nou	um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant
2869	sw04796_s51_1-s51_45.TextGrid	transport	transport_nou	uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that i think we should be doing
2870	sw04130_s9_1-s9_30.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	you know because you know because uh the country s going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients
2871	sw03296_s52_1-s52_32.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	they <unk> come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it s time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that
2872	sw02615_s148_1-s148_5.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	it could really wind up
2873	sw04928_s120_1-s120_40.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away and just wind up having to kiss your ass good <unk> you know
2874	sw03573_s78_1-s78_34.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth
2875	sw03254_s107_1-s107_9.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	and you wind up waiting about an hour
2876	sw02800_s17_1-s17_30.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	and uh i find if you <unk> not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face
2877	sw02479_s252_1-s252_18.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	we all need that time just some quiet time to wind down from the day
2878	sw02568_s122_1-s122_29.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress and seeing like all
2879	sw03541_s32_1-s32_19.TextGrid	wind	wind_vrb	because people that uh do n't make very much money wind up spending it all
