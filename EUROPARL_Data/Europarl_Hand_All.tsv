abuse	abuse_nou	"My initial concerns were as follows: first, although the proposal insists on confidentiality and disidentification of reported information, which is a purely legal issue, it does not satisfactorily tackle the issue of information abuse, especially since data could be made available to third parties through many different channels, including the so-called and loosely-defined ""research institutions"", etc. Aviation is always under close scrutiny by the media and such additional opportunities for reporting would inevitably be misused."

abuses	abuses_nou	I concluded my speech on the Marinho report yesterday evening by observing that the draft resolution, like many before it, seems to ignore the acute problems facing our societies because of abuses of the right to asylum and confines itself to proposals for minor adjustments, accompanying them with almost mantra-like repetition of the need for ‘full, comprehensive application of the 1951 Geneva Convention’ (relating to the status of refugees).

advocate	advocate_nou	Obviously, you have no reason in the final analysis to act as Council' s advocate.
advocate	advocate_nou	As the Advocate General pointed out in paragraph 59 of his Opinion, 'coordination excluding stateless persons and refugees would have meant that the Member States, in order to ensure compliance with their international obligations, had to establish a second coordination regime designed solely for that very restricted category of persons'.

advocate	advocate_vrb	And for those of us who advocate a federal model, that division of competences means that we can establish a federal rather than a subordinate relationship between the Union, the Member States and the regions with legislative powers, which is the foundation for a federal Europe based on the principle of subsidiarity.
advocate	advocate_vrb	I accept that you advocate a conservative programme, and we advocate a progressive programme, but everything is open and we are all going to win the elections, or at least we will also be winners.
advocate	advocate_vrb	They are democratic, political, economic and social crises precisely due to the liberalist, monetarist and technocratic policies that you advocate, passing off old ideas as new.
advocate	advocate_vrb	However, given the current situation, we advocate a neutral increase, which means that we advocate an increase equal to inflation.
advocate	advocate_vrb	I believe that in the life of a nation, the right time for drafting a constitution always comes when it is strong enough to admit its past mistakes and advocate truths that will remain valid for many decades, and is sufficiently steadfast to see through what it has started.
advocate	advocate_nou	There is potential for a trans-Caspian link to central Asia which, as you know, Commissioner, is dear to my heart, and I have always been an advocate of further rapprochement with Kazakhstan.

advocate	advocate_vrb	It comes down to cooperating on stocks conservation in international waters, by contrast to the position and aims of certain coastal countries which advocate a unilateral widening of their prerogatives, contravening international law, the Convention on the Law of the Sea in particular, and the rules governing the high seas and 200-mile exclusion zones.
advocate	advocate_nou	I am not an advocate of either the euro and EMU or the internal market, and for that reason I shall not be supporting the Cox report.
advocate	advocate_nou	You know that I am a great advocate of Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg and I have also regretted all the fuss again made this morning by those who wanted to prevent us from voting today, because they simply want to ruin the Friday sittings in Strasbourg and for everything to be concentrated in Brussels.
advocate	advocate_vrb	On one side, are those who advocate a strong Community approach.
advocate	advocate_vrb	I think that those who advocate this implicitly or explicitly are arguing irresponsibly.
advocate	advocate_vrb	We advocate that countries from central and eastern Europe are able to participate in the fifth framework programme.
advocate	advocate_vrb	We therefore advocate replacing the Stability and Growth Pact with a genuine development and progress pact, and the Lisbon Strategy with a proper economic and social cohesion strategy.
advocate	advocate_vrb	We would therefore advocate - and I personally would advocate - a system of European regulators, basically to create a pan-European market, but we come up against the European framework of references and rules, and I believe that we are going to have to look more closely into this, because the solution that we currently have is an absolute hybrid, I must stress this.
advocate	advocate_vrb	For this reason, too, I advocate elevating the present Subcommittee on Human Rights to the status of full committee.
advocate	advocate_vrb	I also advocate simplifying SMEs' access to the Structural Funds, particularly as regards guarantee schemes, so as to prevent their duplication.
advocate	advocate_vrb	For our part, we will continue to advocate making full use of these funds and making them complement each other, in order to defend and promote production in each country, making use of their potential for combating unemployment and promoting jobs with rights, to create wealth and distribute it better, to advocate quality public services, to combat poverty, and to defend small-scale coastal fishing, family-run farms and small and medium-sized farmers.
advocate	advocate_vrb	They advocate a clear escalation of EU priorities so that we can decide, in a transparent and consensual manner, what we want to support, in a concrete form and with financial support, and what we are supporting from a strictly political point of view, but will this have any impact on the budget?
advocate	advocate_vrb	Mr President, I sincerely hope that during your term in office you will advocate greater involvement by the twelve new Member States in the shaping of European policies.
advocate	advocate_vrb	In Amendment No 2, I advocate quantitative guidelines for education policy, about which, not surprisingly, opinion may be divided.

advocate	advocate_vrb	Junilistan also opposes the passages in the report which blatantly advocate direct control of the bilateral aid schemes of individual EU countries.
advocate	advocate_nou	Being a convinced advocate of the environmentally-responsible market economy, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the possibility of Member States levying duties at less than the stipulated minimum rates on products composed of biofuels.
advocate	advocate_vrb	I advocate a sufficient degree of flexibility to accommodate short-term economic conditions. I also advocate a discussion of fiscal erosion in the context of the stability pact.
affect	affect	My first point concerns the need to make it perfectly clear that the directive does not affect Member States’ freedom to decide on their own system of infrastructure charging for roads.
affect	affect	Mr Goebbels, I would hesitate to describe your speech as a point of order, although it does affect the order of the debates.
affect	affect	Because it is the contracting authorities who publish, this will not affect international competition and, incidentally, the United States already has such a requirement for transparency, with which the EU tenderers have to comply.
affect	affect	So, I think that today we are discussing topics that affect the lives of all citizens, which is why I am persuaded that as far as the bus and coach proposal is concerned, support should be given - and the meeting of the Committee on Transport and Tourism of 30 March showed encouraging signs of this - to the Commission's approach for the widest possible scope, covering all regular passenger transport services whether international, national, regional, urban or suburban.
affect	affect	(PT) Madam President, this is yet another piece of the edifice which is European Union trade policy, an edifice which is growing by the day, with consequences that affect the various Member States profoundly but differently.
affect	affect	I believe that, at a time when so many proposals affect the situation of the outermost regions or regions in general, constant cooperation and communication are a must for all of us.
affect	affect	Liberalisations and economic reforms cannot fail to have an effect on a country's socio-economic situation, and precisely how such changes affect it is primarily dependent on how the necessary structural changes are monitored and on their being made with an ultimate purpose in mind.
affect	affect	There is a prevailing fear that increased cross-border mobility may affect the correct implementation of the Community acquis.
affect	affect	Strictly speaking, this should not affect the UK, which is not a member of the Schengen group, but in reality it will.
affect	affect	This strange political behaviour, so detrimental to Russia itself, cannot tear out the truth about deeds but continues to affect wrongly our European standards and fairness of evaluations.
affect	affect	It will affect our air quality, our water quality, the general quality of our environment throughout the whole of Europe and beyond in the coming years if we bring it to fruition.
affect	affect	It would in fact be more accurate to refer to a European Union-NAFTA agreement rather than an agreement associating the European Union with Mexico only. For this agreement, which the rapporteur herself describes as the most important one the European Union has ever signed with a third country, will not only affect our relations with Mexico but will also have implications for our relations with the North and Central American countries as a whole.
affect	affect	If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too.
affect	affect	Such a ban would not affect subsistence farming, but it would demonstrate a commitment to protect animal welfare.
affect	affect	There is also the establishment of task assessments which we will do through a series of pilot schemes that will affect around one quarter of the Directorate-Generals in the first instance and then the compilation of job descriptions which will be undertaken over the period up to the end of July this year.
affect	affect	I nevertheless consider the method suggested in this report will affect the precarious balance of competition by undermining its foundations, since it would have to be applied on a global scale.
affect	affect	More than that, it could conceivably affect the very future of the WTO and tip the balance away from free trade to protectionism.
affect	affect	Secondly, we must determine the responsibility of those who managed the crisis, in particular, we must clarify the reason why the EU as a whole was not involved in managing the risk from the very outset, given that it was known that the consequences of the accident would easily move beyond the confines of one country and would affect the entire natural heritage of Europe.
affect	affect	We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.
affect	affect	I ask the Commission to listen because I am going to ask for clarification; according to this article we would vote for a ban on these substances within the European Union, but this ban would not affect their manufacture or marketing within the European Union, since we could send them to another Member State with a view to their export to third countries.
affect	affect	The new questions arising in this field affect people's everyday lives and ought therefore to be very carefully investigated.
affect	affect	These health and social problems, which affect the whole of Europe, require coordinated measures designed to ensure the effectiveness of the prevention, diagnoses, treatment and care provided to the people concerned.
affect	affect	The latter can also consider their position now, in good time, and participate in making decisions which affect them.
affect	affect	This will allow cheap chicken to be brought into the European Union, which will unfortunately affect the most disadvantaged people who shop in discount supermarkets, and we will find this chlorinated chicken in processed products, catering trays and school canteens.
affect	affect	The consumption even of small quantities of alcohol during pregnancy can adversely affect the child's development.
affect	affect	For this reason, during this term in office, we have introduced into each parliamentary committee a Member responsible for monitoring gender issues, which cannot be dealt with in an isolated fashion, in a kind of conceptual ghetto, but which must affect all policies horizontally.
affect	affect	There is, of course, no direct effect of antibiotics on the genes, but there is an indirect link insofar as antibiotics can affect natural selection, that is, nature's own evolutionary process.
affect	affect	Fundamentalisms affect more than just the lives of women, they affect the lives of people in general, and for that reason they must be opposed and rejected on principle for they are at the root of a vision of society that is based on conflict.
affect	affect	He rightly expands on removing the breeding ground for terrorism and states that the fight against terrorism should not adversely affect human rights.
affect	affect	The second question is: If the ferry companies' income is to be reduced by approximately 30 per cent, which probably will be the case if duty-free trade is abolished, how will this affect transport charges?
affect	affect	The review of the regulation in question does not affect eligible expenditure in housing and strengthens the activity of important sectors of the economy such as the construction industry and the sectors which build energy systems and renewable energy systems.
affect	affect	Moreover, I would draw your attention to the fact that, even though embryonic stem cells do after all affect first and foremost women, and what women carry within them, there is no question of their becoming research instruments, economically speaking.
affect	affect	These include mandatory women's quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any.
affect	affect	The fact is that these increases primarily affect poorer people who have to spend more than half their income on food.
affect	affect	The explosion will hit not just Asia, but in the end will also affect Europe and the European Union.
aged	aged	A month ago, Mr President, in Strasbourg, I met the mother of a young British man, aged 19, who had died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
aged	aged	Orlando Zapata, aged 42, was declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.

aged	aged	Mr President, Commissioner, according to the International Labour Organisation, whether we like it or not, we are indirectly responsible for the fate of 250 million children aged 5 to 14 years.
aged	aged	The 96 million young Europeans aged between 15 and 29 account for approximately 20% of the European Union's population.
aged	aged_adj	Over the last 20 years there have been very few new nuclear reactors built in Europe. This means that we have a lot of aged reactors that continue to be in full operation.
aged	aged	And, let me remind you, we still know nothing of the fate of Gevrij, aged 6, Ilse, aged 19, Élisabeth, aged 12 - whose father, as you will remember, appeared in this House and showed us her paintings, in an unforgettable expression of grief - Nathalie, aged 9, Lubna, aged 9, Sylvie, aged 19, Ken, aged 8, and Yann, aged 12.
aged	aged	It is terrible to think that children aged between 7 and 15 are used as modern-day slaves in a wide variety of work, and sometimes for the sexual perversions of certain people.

aged	aged	Thanks to the voluntary service, all young people aged 18-25 years - and sometimes as old as 29 - will be able to take part in public utility actions across the Union.
aged	aged	International Human Rights Day was marked in Hebron by the intolerable image of two children aged three and 13 blown apart by an Israeli missile that missed its suspect target.
aged	aged	If current trends continue, the population structure of the European Union will develop as follows over the coming 30 years: the over-60 age group will increase by 50 %; the number of adults aged between 20 and 59 will fall by 6 %; and the number of young people aged between 0 and 19 will fall by 11 %.
aged	aged	I refer to a Polish citizen aged 42 who was kidnapped.
aged	aged_adj	Still on the subject of game, I do, however, have reservations regarding the Commission's proposal, and in particular the presence of aged open fractures.
aged	aged	Clearly, however, under the agreement, a wine will have to be aged in oak barrels before the term 'barrel-aged' could be used on the label.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	Could he make plain his predilections in this area, especially as yesterday's FT report on the uncertainty of monetary aggregate statistics cast doubt on whether we need to worry about their sharp growth?
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	The wealth measured in dollars of the world's 358 multimillionaires exceeds the aggregate annual income of countries accounting for about half the world's population.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	In the euro zone, price stability is a reality; in quite a few sectors, indeed, aggregate rates of price increase below two per cent are opening the door to deflation, but as soon as there is the slightest indication of economic recovery in the euro zone, the only way the ECB, with its blind fixation on price stability, knows how to respond is by raising interest rates.
aggregate	aggregate_vrb	Credit rating agency (CRA) ratings fulfil several useful purposes: they aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers in a global environment.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	I have given these aggregate figures for four reasons.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	An area-wide model used at the ECB, which models the aggregate behaviour of the euro area economy, will be published in this working paper series by ECB staff, probably at the end of this year or early next year.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	I also think that everything concerned with basic information, related to the democratic rule of law, must be available free of charge and the remaining information should be available at a marginal cost that would not exceed the aggregate costs of their reproduction and dissemination, without prejudice to the specific system to be defined by the public cultural sector for obvious reasons of intellectual and artistic copyright.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	There are many very valuable elements in European culture, but instead of enjoying the aggregate of those elements we seem to achieve only an arithmetical average.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	Unfortunately, such discussions are limited to the examination of individual taxes and not the assessment of the aggregate impact of each tax type upon the economy.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	There have recently been less favourable developments in the aggregate money supply, which, however, have a silver lining in that they indicate recovery, being a sign that enterprises are obtaining liquidity for investment in future economic growth, and this, for Europe, is a matter of life and death.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	In the report itself, Amendment No 5 relating to Article 3(2) reads accurately as follows: 'shall not exceed three years on aggregate and may be extended for no more than three years following a further decision.'
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	At the aggregate level, the gap in living standards can be attributed to two factors: two-thirds to the employment rate, which is lower, and one-third to productivity.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	With regard to aggregate MRLs, if, for example, there are two or three different pesticides, but they are all below the MRLs, the combination should say that they should not be on the market.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	We hope that we can find actions which will help to bolster aggregate demand; on the demand side, we want to reduce inflationary pressures and help the purchasing power of households.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	All in all, then, we have a budget for year two of the financial perspective period with a volume of EUR 120.3 billion, corresponding to 0.96% of the Member States' aggregate gross national income, a budget that is very heavily geared to fiscal discipline.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	Although CRA ratings fulfil several useful purposes (for example, they aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers, which is particularly helpful in our global environment), developments in the regulatory framework have turned these 'information intermediaries' into de facto 'regulatory licensors', a mistake that we must not make!
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	Irish aggregate farm income increased by 2.2% in 2003 to EUR 2.524 billion, and estimated direct payments of EUR 1.6 billion accounted for 64% of this figure.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	Given that up to two thirds of aggregate demand in Europe comes from outside, demand stimuli that are applied only at regional or national level will obviously peter out.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	This perhaps means that in the future we will have to consider the need for our own statistical information which is not an aggregate of national statistics.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	Some only contribute marginally to European aggregate data, while others are the driving force of the common market.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	I am pleased that I have made a contribution to the requirement that applications must include the undertaking that the mobile satellite system proposed will provide a service in at least 60% of the aggregate land area of the Member States, from the time the service commences.
aggregate	aggregate_adj-nou	There is no aggregate consciousness that would suffer more distress than a single one.

alternate	alternate_vrb	There we hope to see a separation of powers and guarantees that governments will alternate in power, and we are sure that the necessary interrelationship between economic modernisation and political modernisation will increasingly prosper.
alternate	alternate_adj-nou	Secondly, we need to consider if alternate corridors are possible in areas which possibly have less mixed traffic.
alternate	alternate_adj-nou	The United States have an action plan on energy security involving the initiation and development of alternate routes for the transport of oil and gas.
alternate	alternate_adj-nou	Alternate rules operate quite legally within the Internet, but have relatively limited visibility and can be difficult to access, because the majority of browsers, quite naturally, point at names servers related to ICANN-authorised top-level domains.
alternate	alternate_vrb	Throughout his or her life, the individual must alternate between work and training, moving from one to the other without any unwanted break.
alternate	alternate_vrb	Days of unbroken drought alternate with days of torrential rain and with heat waves.
alternate	alternate_vrb	I would remind you that, at the moment, they are changing from great heat to great cold, with no mid-season, that in spring and autumn they alternate between very high temperatures, like those of July, and very low temperatures, like those of January, and that the winds are strong and sometimes devastating.
alternate	alternate_vrb	All year round, parched dry days alternate with days of torrential rain.
alternate	alternate_vrb	We hope that the Council will be able to adopt your proposal for the governing council, which, together with the rotating system, will allow representatives from all Member States to alternate over a period of three mandates.
alternate	alternate_vrb	We know how to alternate Community responses - and I hope the arrest warrant and our response will be worthy of us - with the proper degree of subsidiarity.
alternate	alternate_vrb	Consequently, I can only give the floor to two Members of the House per question and naturally I shall use the usual criterion of seeking to alternate between political groups.
alternate	alternate_vrb	Her very physical location - which will alternate between the benches of the Council, here, and the Commission - exemplifies her wish to wear two hats.
alternate	alternate_vrb	I shall alternate speeches according to the groups of the speakers.
alternate	alternate_vrb	We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia.
alternate	alternate_vrb	I fully support this initiative of European pathways for training, enabling young people to alternate their work-linked training between Member States.
alternate	alternate_adj-nou	Mr Powell and Mr Solana keep travelling there - on alternate weeks.
alternate	alternate_vrb	As is the case in the United States, the work of scientists should alternate between academia and industry.
alternate	alternate_vrb	The place of the state has been taken by a number of warlords, who alternate between fighting and cooperating with each other.
alternate	alternate_vrb	Floods alternate with dry months, and this calls for a new water management strategy.
alternate	alternate_adj-nou	Mr President, I did not vote for this report, despite being in favour of the text adopted by the Convention - which I took part in as an alternate - because the report has left out the reference to Europe's Christian roots.
alternate	alternate_adj-nou	We said we were willing, and we stand by that promise, to give up one member and one alternate.
alternate	alternate_adj-nou	I have to say that during the Convention, in which I was proud to take part as an alternate member, I respected - though I did not always agree with - the positions taken by the United Kingdom Government representatives.
analyses	analyses_vrb	I consider this report very topical, as it analyses the current situation and seeks to identify solutions that would support the rural areas and islands of Europe.
analyses	analyses_vrb	Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in its communication the Commission identifies culture as being a sector with strong employment potential and analyses the link existing between culture and regional development.
analyses	analyses_vrb	That report analyses the situation with regard to delayed flights and proposes some short-term measures to address the problem and puts forward some ideas about how the problem should be tackled in the longer term.
analyses	analyses_nou	Based on further economic analyses, possible modifications to the de minimis regime for fisheries will also be considered, so that the ceiling of EUR 30 000 per three years would be applied per vessel, rather than per firm - though with an overall cap of EUR 100 000 per firm.
analyses	analyses_nou	Mr President, please allow me first of all to draw your attention to the need for caution when making our analyses and comments.
analyses	analyses_nou	Mr President, I have to say that I have been addressing Parliament for six and a half years now, and this is the first time that I have noted so many speeches, so many analyses, so many suggestions and so many proposals.
analyses	analyses_nou	We therefore favour giving the European Environment Agency powers to collect the necessary data on the implementation by individual Member States of the common policy on waste management, if these comparative analyses can promote the codification of European waste policy.
analyses	analyses_nou	According to recent analyses by international financial institutes and credit-rating agencies, a major economic decline is to be expected in south-eastern Europe accompanied by the danger of loan default on the part of consumers and undertakings.
analyses	analyses_nou	These are vehicles for deeper analyses of social trends and are also a forum for debate which extends beyond the party membership.
analyses	analyses_nou	I would also like to show my support for the rapporteur's suggestions, both on a conclusive definition of waste and on taking all the necessary steps against recalcitrant governments. I agree with most of the analyses and proposals made by our colleague.
analyses	analyses_nou	Later on we are going to talk with you about the stress tests, in other words the safety analyses for the 143 nuclear power plants.
analyses	analyses_nou	With due respect to the WHO, I would like to point out that there are expert analyses available on this topic, such as the study by the team lead by Mrs Fillmore that was published in 2006: these studies show that analysis of the benefits of alcohol was based on the wrong data and that it also included, for example, older people who have stopped drinking and casual drinkers.
analyses	analyses_nou	Is political coordination based on analyses and statistics debated by the same politicians, officials and experts at conferences around the EU really binding enough?
analyses	analyses_nou	I should like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Luxembourg Presidency, which has demonstrated great political flair and a tireless willingness to compromise; to the Commission, which has provided technical analyses and guidance in support of the negotiations; and, finally, to my fellow MEP Mr Březina, whose active participation in the meetings and unfailing support I valued very highly.
analyses	analyses_nou	Through cost-benefit analyses we will take steps to assess whether specific actions achieve their objectives, what their impact was compared to the quantity of expenditure allocated, and what European added value they contributed.
analyses	analyses_nou	Since such 'analyses' and proposals are questionable to say the least and totally contrary to the fundamental right of freedom of expression and the right to demonstrate, will the Council state its official position on this matter?
analyses	analyses_nou	So we need informative data, analyses and conclusions, and we need them quickly, Commissioner.
analyses	analyses_nou	For this, what is essential is reliable, independent research and analyses setting out the ecological risks and establishing proper mechanisms for monitoring activities in this area.
analyses	analyses_nou	Commissioner Wallström, I must give my particular support to the approach to set up cost-benefit analyses.
analyses	analyses_nou	Regarding the analyses you refer to, I would like to know on what sort of objective analyses they are based, as I am concerned about the health of all of us and, similarly, the livelihoods of tobacco farmers.
analyses	analyses_nou	What is going on at the moment is that additional information and analyses have been asked for from various parties - including within the Commission.
analyses	analyses_nou	We are also very insistent in calling for the European Parliament to be informed of the substance of the analyses of the crisis situations these countries are facing. This is because, when the Commission grants its loans to countries outside the euro zone, there is a certain transparency and substance to the information on the behaviour of private banks and on the behaviour of operators which has led to this crisis, that the European Parliament must be informed of.
analyses	analyses_nou	The regulation on pesticides and the analyses for approval are very delayed, since of the over eight hundred active areas to be regulated, not even one hundred have been analysed.
analyses	analyses_nou	It is only in that spirit, on the basis of objective criteria and analyses carried out by our services, in conjunction with international experts, as Mr Van den Broek has said - we did not take part for political reasons - that we have announced which applicant countries can begin negotiations to be completed in the medium term.
analyses	analyses_nou	We have basically agreed on the timetable for the future liberalisation of exchanges and this will be done the following way: in 1997 and until the first half of 1998 the bodies provided for in the agreement - mixed committee, trade sub-committee and various working parties - will focus all of their attention on working out what we have called the 'radiography of exchanges' , in other words working out all of the relevant technical analyses which will make it possible for us to make progress towards the ambitious objectives which have been set out in our strategy.
analyses	analyses_nou	If we look back over the debates in Parliament or the reports on financial stability by the Monetary Fund or the Central Bank, the analyses by the European Commission and our own speeches in the recent past, we did not know where or when, but we did know that turbulence of this kind could occur, given the evolution of the financial markets, and the sophistication of the instruments and techniques used by financial institutions.
analyses	analyses_nou	The Commission should not carry out detailed analyses of the causes of forest fires.
analyses	analyses_nou	We would be happy to have a consistent approach with respect to cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments on any policies, including the recruitment of administrative staff and administrative expenditure.
analyses	analyses_nou	Its tasks included both risk analyses and preventative measures.
analyses	analyses_nou	However, over the last few days the Greek press has reported - on the basis of information from the above persons or their lawyers - that 'some of them intend to alter their confessions with the aim of securing their release in 10-12 years' time'and have invoked the status of 'political prisoner' on the basis of 'similar instances in other European countries', as press publications and TV analyses have reported.
analyses	analyses_nou	These analyses should make it possible to work out the best practices likely to contribute to the strengthening of the effectiveness of future programmes.
analyses	analyses_nou	Further analyses will just lead to a further delay in the decisions that we really have to take.
analyses	analyses_nou	One, in 1996, called on the Commission to create a Crisis prevention network (CPN) to take on the role of strategic monitoring so that the analyses, diagnoses and proposals could be inter-European.
analyses	analyses_nou	In our opinion this optimism reflects an intention and an attempt to create a climate conducive to an economic policy strategy which are in no way worthy of the holy water contained in today's analyses, and similarly cannot, if they are followed, bear out the optimistic tone of the forecasts for the future.
analyses	analyses_nou	Analyses have been prepared for countries or groups of states, which take account of all the economic and energy indexes.
analyses	analyses_vrb	Specifically, this report analyses the issue of Member States' excessive debts and considers the problems of the European Union as a whole, not just in the sense of resolving the deficits, but also the level of public debt, so as to ensure that procedures are implemented with a view to correcting the infringement early on and thus prevent corrective measures from being implemented when it is already too late.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	Technically, this is of course an approximate solution. It is not a scientifically accurate solution, but, as an approximate solution, I consider it to be satisfactory, and I propose that we accept it.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	On the other hand, it is a known fact that the European Union has an approximate 55 % deficit in fish supplies for its market.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	The figures, that is the approximate figures which I have received so far have been in the region of between 15 billion and 64 billion ECUs.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	As several French Socialist Members have claimed the right during the debate on the fight against money laundering to put certain countries in the hot seat, including mine, on the basis of an erroneous, approximate and aberrant appraisal of the practices of Luxembourg as a financial centre and the Luxembourg political powers, I am anxious to refute here in the House, and as vigorously as our Prime Minister and the chairmen of the finance, budget and legal committees of the Chamber of Deputies of the Grand Duchy have done, the allegations which the French Socialist Members have become guilty of during their so-called 'assault course' against dirty money.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	What we will do is, along with the Director of the plenary services, look at a way that we can have an approximate idea - as it will never be exact, but at least an approximate idea - of which of you are going to speak, so that we can minimise the number that are waiting.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	The very approximate loss estimation is EUR 2.289 million with, for example, EUR 60 000 also lost with the bombing of the forensic laboratory which we had provided.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	However, the report clearly expresses principles governing a distribution that by its nature will be approximate in the final analysis.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	Until such times as these questions receive serious answers and even approximate estimates made of the cost of enlargement, enlargement will remain a step into the unknown, both for the present as well as future member states.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	Is the Council Presidency in possession of approximate estimates as to how many new jobs this will create in rural areas?
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	It is, however, my intention, over a period of years – over a decade, indeed – to sketch out a vision and to set out the approximate stages by which these things may be implemented in practice, while setting out even now the further steps whereby we are contemplating the implementing stage of Euro 6.
approximate	approximate_vrb	We have common targets for air quality and are currently negotiating with the Council to approximate the rules on national ceilings for emissions and large incineration plants.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	A 'compromise proposal' which nonetheless enables an approximate 6 % increase in the Structural Funds whereas the CAP (with a 0.5 %) and the budget as a whole (3 %) have been subjected to austerity, just like the finances of the Member States.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	I must then at least do an approximate calculation of the potential climatic effects of the global increase in energy production.
approximate	approximate_vrb	However, the presidency regards it as rather difficult and not very useful to approximate the penalties so long as the general penal provisions, especially the prosecution system, the list of penalties, the imposition of penalties and the conditions governing mitigation are based on different systems.
approximate	approximate_vrb	With the Amsterdam Treaty the European Union will have the possibility to approximate rules relating to prison conditions.
approximate	approximate_vrb	To sum up, if a clear legal position is to be established, it is essential to approximate the most important provisions of the law on insurance contracts and insurance conditions. Our citizens will then be able to shop around in an open market and make a choice which is in their own best interest, not that of the insurance undertakings.
approximate	approximate_vrb	It will certainly be no easy matter to identify minimum standards, for two reasons. The first relates to the practical problem posed by legal codification, for a complex process will have to be launched to approximate the - at present, extremely diverse - laws of the Member States.
approximate	approximate_vrb	. (DE) The report on the proposal to approximate the laws of Member States relating to food supplements is one more step in the right direction of disclosing the unnatural content of foodstuffs.
approximate	approximate_vrb	By the same token, the Community has no competence to adopt provisions whose efect is to approximate national criminal provisions.
approximate	approximate_vrb	The Union must make efforts to approximate criminal law and procedures on money laundering and the confiscation of goods.
approximate	approximate_vrb	The Commission proposal aims to approximate criminal offences of unauthorised access or illegal interference with information systems and follows consultation with professional sectors and with the authorities responsible for implementing the law, as well as discussions with experts in the European Union forum on cybercrime.
approximate	approximate_vrb	Thus, for the Commission to suggest that we approximate our laws on food supplements is in fact to propose creating laws that do not exist at present in the UK.
approximate	approximate_vrb	The Commission is assisting this ancient kingdom to become the ecological republic in the garden of nations, as Mr Paleckis said, by strengthening the administrative capacity of Montenegro, which in turn makes the country better able to approximate its laws to ours, for instance in the field of waste management and water treatment.
approximate	approximate_vrb	It seeks to approximate laws with common minimum penalties.
approximate	approximate_vrb	In short, I think that Parliament has contributed to improving the proposal for a framework decision intended to provide a response to cybercrime by seeking to approximate the legal provisions of the Member States in order to guarantee that all attacks against information systems become a criminal offence and by promoting police and judicial cooperation.
approximate	approximate_vrb	Following this consultation, the Commission intends to look into whether a legislative measure is needed at European level to approximate these rules, which are common to the Member States and which are contained in the European Convention on Human Rights and, in this way, to increase mutual trust between Member States, whilst at the same time providing guarantees of legal certainty.
approximate	approximate_vrb	The purpose of the directive being debated today, eighteen months after the Commission submitted its proposal, is to approximate the various laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted by the Member States, in order to remove obstacles to the internal market and safeguard the free movement of goods and services and this is in keeping with the rules set out in the directive.
approximate	approximate_vrb	. (FR) This seventh amendment to Directive 76/768/EEC on cosmetic products is essential because, apart from the fact that it seeks to approximate the various laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products, its main objective is to put in place a lasting and definitive ban on the performance of animal experiments for finished cosmetic products in the European Union.
approximate	approximate_vrb	The main elements of the agreement are the establishment of a free trade area between the Community and Fyrom within a ten-year period after the entry into force of the agreement, the establishment of a political dialogue, provisions on regional cooperation provisions on the freedom of movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, a commitment by the Fyrom authorities to approximate legislation to that of the European Community especially in the internal market, cooperation in areas such as justice and home affairs, establishment of a stabilisation and association council that supervises the implementation of the agreement.
approximate	approximate_vrb	On 10 October, the Commission proposed a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to approximate air transport security and safety standards within the European Union, and also to give the Commission the power of execution and inspection in order to ensure that the standards are being applied.
approximate	approximate_adj-nou	The object of this regulation is to at least make these rules more closely approximate, and that is an aim that is, as far as I am aware, supported by all the groups in this House, so we can content ourselves with making changes in a few areas, for example to the rules that put crew on freight flights at a disadvantage, where changes really do have to be made.
associate	associate_adj-nou	Turkey, by the way, is part of NATO and, therefore, in that respect, for some of the countries of the European Union, Turkey is also an associate in the sphere of that military alliance.
associate	associate_vrb	I think that we cannot help but associate this attitude with political collusion with Mr Berlusconi.
associate	associate_vrb	In our opinion, the processes of self-determination, of independence and freedom to associate as desired, should take precedence over the territorial integrity of this or that entity.
associate	associate_vrb	Finally, I associate my vote with those of my French socialist colleagues on the matter of lead piping, asking for a period of adaptation.
associate	associate_vrb	on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I associate the common rules for the operation of air transport services in the Community with the third aviation package or with problems relating to its practical implementation.
associate	associate_vrb	Mr President, I associate myself with everything Mr de Roo has said, and his outrage at these events is shared by many in the United Kingdom, which is the principal destination for these adulterated products.
associate	associate_adj-nou	During the visit I had a first-hand opportunity to observe how the rule of law is upheld in Russia when attending the trial of the former Yukos boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and his business associate, Platon Lebedev.
associate	associate_adj-nou	Together with our Mediterranean partners, we must lay the foundations of an associate common market, capable of interacting satisfactorily with Europe' s economy, taking local parameters of development in the South into consideration.
associate	associate_adj-nou	Turkey is an Associate Country and we demand more, much more than this from an Associate.
associate	associate_vrb	Indeed, the more people know about the origin of goods and come to associate that origin with particular features or the quality of those goods, it may encourage them to buy those goods from those sources and places of origin.
associate	associate_vrb	This proactive attitude is what the vast majority of European citizens want because they associate the excessive red tape and high administrative costs, and also the fragmentation of the car market, with the difficulties in consolidating the internal market.
associate	associate_vrb	We want to associate the two institutions, Community and national, in evaluation, analysis, objectives and especially urgent situations.
associate	associate_vrb	I want to associate myself with the words of Mr Goerens and, indeed, take the Commission a little further.
associate	associate_vrb	Mrs Müller stresses the need to associate the Commission at the very beginning of the preparation of each joint action in recital Q of her report.
associate	associate_vrb	I would like to associate myself very fully indeed with the tone of this question, but I think that there are a number of points that flow from it, because the resources that it needs are not just at Commission level as you, Commissioner, pointed out.
associate	associate_vrb	Mr President, I too wish to associate myself with the words of my colleague, Mr Herbert Bösch, congratulating Mrs Langenhagen on the content of her report, and say that the issue of simplifying these programmes and making them more transparent - and this is discussed in the report by the Court of Auditors - is by far the most important and decisive issue for their success.
associate	associate_vrb	Firstly I would like to associate myself entirely with the remarks of my colleague from Northern Ireland, Mr Nicholson, with regard to the atrocious situation that has befallen Annetta Flanigan, a lady who has given selfless service to Afghanistan.
associate	associate_vrb	When it is in their interests to associate with or sign agreements with non-European companies, and in particular American companies, the opinion of the European institutions will not be able to prevent them from doing so.
associate	associate_vrb	China is now willing to associate itself with this coordination mechanism and to participate in the protection.
associate	associate_vrb	My last point is that there is now a great responsibility on all international actors in the current situation - particularly the sponsors of the Olympic torch, such as Coca Cola, Samsung and Lenovo - not to associate themselves with the highly repressive situation in the region.
associate	associate_vrb	If I may associate myself with Mrs Larive's broader points, the Community prospers the greater the more it is a Community of law, rules and of predictability.
associate	associate_vrb	Speaking on behalf of my group, though, I wish to associate myself with Mr Barón Crespo's proposal that we should - in view of the Liberals' inability to gain a majority on the subject - mandate the President to issue a statement in which, without risking our position being misunderstood, and without the statement being tinged with any sort of anti-Americanism, we express our opposition to capital punishment.
associate	associate_vrb	This is one of the structural transformations of Europe that history will associate with your name and the Commission you have presided over, and also with your valuable and intense participation in the work on the Constitution, which will be subject to a referendum.
associate	associate_adj-nou	The establishment of a single fund is not possible at present, not among the associate states of Central Europe, given the present status of the Treaty - Article 130c - and the differences arising in procedural matters and in the financing of programmes, depending on whether the State concerned is a Member State or a third country.
associate	associate_adj-nou	In fact, cross-border cooperation between these countries and those of the European Union has made contact between the border regions possible at the political level and thus increased the degree of trust and good neighbourliness between them. At the same time it is allowing stable habits of cooperation to develop, familiarizing the CCEEs with the Union's management methods and, above all, encouraging in the associate countries the sense of belonging to a common area, hence accelerating the process of adaptation prior to accession.
associate	associate_adj-nou	The opportunity for participation by the associate countries in central and eastern Europe is positive with the emphasis has to be on the countries which are serious candidates for entry such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
associate	associate_adj-nou	Mr President, to conclude I would like to touch on another important theme. I wish to emphasis anew the importance of the proposal to throw open the SAVE programme to associate countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
associate	associate_adj-nou	Does it mean we will just be associate members, or will we be out?
associate	associate_vrb	I would therefore like to make two requests, Mr López Garrido: keep the targets of fighting poverty and the targets promoting better education, which are in the Commission's text but not in the Council's text, and associate Parliament with the voice of the people, so that the people's agenda can be Europe's agenda, rather than it being the agenda of technocrats or of the so-called 'markets', which is often the agenda of speculators.
associate	associate_vrb	I would like to know if you can distinguish between Mr Bloom and me or whether I am to regret that you associate us both in the same struggle because we clearly hold radically opposing positions.
associate	associate_vrb	We associate quite particular ideas and expectations with traditional and geographical labels.
associate	associate_vrb	I also have something to say to the Commission. So, Commissioner, please tell the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, that, tomorrow, when we deal with Mr von Wogau's report, with financial services and with everything we associate with 'Lamfalussy' , we expect the Commission to take up a position in defence of Parliament's rights vis-à-vis the Council of Ministers.
associate	associate_vrb	Mr President, I would otherwise like to associate myself with the many comments of my fellow Members about the precise technical and legal problems with this.
associate	associate_vrb	I want to associate myself fully with the comments of Mr Cavada, who I believe has taken a really constructive approach.
bass	bass_corp	Further, within the framework of existing legislation, the Commission is launching initiatives to deal with problems affecting the market in specific species. Sea bream and bass are two current examples.
bass	bass_corp	Amendments Nos 3-5: the purpose of these amendments is to increase the newly proposed tariff quota for sea bream and sea bass from 100 tonnes to 200 tonnes.
bass	bass_corp	The Commission's proposal for a new tariff quota for certain fish species merits support, but more desirable still, in all honesty, is a doubling of the quota for sea bass and sea bream, as the rapporteur proposes.
bass	bass_corp	This is not a run-of-the-mill enterprise, but one of the future, entailing dignified, state-of-the art activities involving fish as noble as bass, bream and turbot. With obvious limits of which account has to be taken, it entails great scientific innovations and research into vaccines, genetically modified organisms and diploid or triploid oysters.
bass	None	At that meeting we were able to come up with measures to be taken in the ensuing few months. To quote some examples, the temporary suspension of public aid for the creation of new production capacity, the launch of a study on the market for bass and sea bream, and the effort to organise a campaign to promote international sales.
bass	bass_corp	The rapporteur has found a worthy solution to this problem within the framework defined by the proposal for a Council regulation, increasing the quota for fresh or frozen sea bass and sea bream.
bass	None	We marvelled at the skills displayed by sturgeon producers in Granada. We realised the significance of the experimental farming of sea bream and bass in former Roman salt pans in the province of Cadiz.
buffet	None	on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, the great investor, Warren Buffet, once said 'when the tide goes down, you kind of get to see who is not wearing a bathing costume'.
buffet	None	When I visit Sydney for the Olympic Games, I shall endeavour, together with Mrs Buffet, to meet with sports ministers from the other continents with a view to widening the range of our action and establishing bonds of solidarity among political leaders at a global level.
buffet	None	I am pleased that the French Government, spurred on by Marie-George Buffet, has taken the initiative on a bill to fight doping and to protect the health of sportsmen and women.
buffet	None	Thank goodness we have President Buffet and the French Presidency which, I think, has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures.
buffet	None	I also listened with great interest to the words of Mrs Buffet, who shed valuable light on our deliberations.
buffet	None	The French Government's attitude towards this issue has been firm and proactive, thanks to a bill being piloted through parliament by Marie-George Buffet, Minister for Youth and Sport, and the action of our former colleague, Bernard Kouchner, Minister for Health.
buffet	None	Minister Buffet, who has addressed us so eloquently here today, stated in Le Monde on 4 August that the basic ingredient missing in the fight against doping was strong political will.
buffet	None	I have naturally taken note of Mrs Buffet's statements.
buffet	None	To that end, on 17 April I hosted a meeting in Brussels with all the European sports federations, and I shall do so again, together with Mrs Buffet, on 26 and 27 October.
buffet	None	I know that Mrs Buffet fully shares the Commission' s views and I am also aware of Parliament' s views in this regard.
buffet	None	I must congratulate the European Commission on the action plan it has proposed, together with the rapporteur and Mrs Buffet, President-in-Office of the Council.
buffet	None	With her Italian opposite number, Giovanna Melandri, Marie-George Buffet has just approached the German sports minister to ask him to arrange a meeting of the sports ministers of the Fifteen before the opening of the conference being held by the International Olympic Committee on 2 and 3 February in Lausanne, to examine proposals they might formulate or support.
buffet	None	As you know, and as Mrs Buffet mentioned, the voluntarist approach of the European Union enabled this Agency to see the light of day.
buffet	None	The other was of the French extreme-left leaders, Besancenot from the Revolutionary Communist League, and Buffet from the Communist Party, marching with the imams.
buffet	None	The campaign by the French Minister for Youth Affairs and Sport, Mrs Marie-Georges Buffet made them take greater responsibility and this action has borne fruit.
buffet	None	Mrs Buffet has been tackling this issue in France, and I congratulate her for it.
buffet	buffet_vrb	Environmental concerns can never be jeopardised, but at the same time, they cannot be detached from economic issues; still less in this time of crisis that we are still experiencing, and which continues to buffet the countries of southern Europe, especially my country, Portugal.
celtic	celtic	We will be delighted if Ireland is able to achieve this, not only because Ireland is a Celtic country like my own, Galicia, but also because this would show, once again, that it is one of the Union’s great pro-European countries.
celtic	celtic	Parts of the constituency that I represent in the border counties and the West of Ireland have not felt the effects of this Celtic Tiger.
celtic	celtic	Three out of the four legs under the Celtic Tiger were provided as a result of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and other funding from the European Union.
celtic	celtic	"My country, Ireland, has seen a very welcome reversal in its economic fortunes over the past five years but even our ""Celtic Tiger' suffers from the cancer of unemployment."
celtic	celtic	The Minister has had a very long day, so I am just going to suggest that, from the point of view of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, he look at the example of Ireland, where the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund played a major part in transforming a third world economy into what is the Celtic Tiger.
celtic	celtic	In so doing, it may finally turn on its head the old Anglo-Saxon misconception about the intellect of England's Celtic neighbours.
celtic	celtic_adj-nou-sports	If it is not, will he give us an assurance that there will be urgent discussions between the Community and Monaco to settle problems such as Celtic Football Club has experienced?
celtic	celtic_adj-nou-sports	Given the problem which Glasgow Celtic Football Club had with Monaco over the transfer of John Collins, would the President-in-Office enlighten us as to whether freedom of movement of footballers and other Community citizens is part of the agreement with Monaco?
celtic	None	Yet the latest maps on the Arc Manche region change the name of the English Channel to the 'Greater North Sea' and call the Bristol Channel the 'Celtic Sea'.
celtic	celtic	Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.
celtic	celtic	The Celtic Tiger, which was solely responsible for its own growth, with an atypical tax system, minimal banking regulation and an investment code unlike that of any other country in the European Union, is today witnessing a collapse of its property bubble, household debt, record unemployment and a crippled banking sector.
celtic	celtic	Is or is not the Celtic Sea to be included in a recovery plan?
celtic	celtic	While Ireland has proposed a pilot project for 2009 to reduce cod discards in our Nephrops fishery in part of the Celtic Sea, hopefully with incentives for fishermen and a major role for them in monitoring and control which will be key to successful enforcement of the project, I must however ask the Commissioner a question in the light of what our rapporteur referred to as 'new evaluations suggesting the Celtic Sea is over-exploited and so needs to be controlled', according to ICES a 2009 TAC for the Celtic Sea area was recommended which indicates that the stock is stronger there than in other areas covered by the recovery plan.
celtic	celtic	Today's budget in Ireland reflects the good health of our celtic tiger.
celtic	celtic	The Celtic Sea has been included in the recovery plan because new evaluations indicate that cod stocks are also being overexploited there and are in a poor state.
celtic	celtic	You became Finance Minister just as Ireland’s Celtic Tiger was transforming the country from one of the EU’s poorest nations to its financial summit.
celtic	celtic	The Celtic Tiger, for which you claim credit in Ireland, has given us 150 000 children living in poverty in Ireland.
celtic	celtic	In the case of the Celtic Sea, the situation is somewhat better but still the state of this stock is far from good.
celtic	celtic	One example of this is the 'Celtic' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.
celtic	celtic	The Celtic Tiger has shown itself to be a lame duck that the rest of Europe has to lend a helping hand and take by its limp wings.
celtic	celtic	The Celtic tiger has long stood for the benefits of competitiveness and economic discipline.
celtic	celtic	Spiegel Online writes 'The Celtic Tiger has been taken into intensive care'.
celtic	celtic	I am your Celtic sister from Scotland and you have a lot to live up to because the previous Irish presidencies have been such a success.
celtic	celtic	The generosity of our EU partners in this regard has played a significant part in the performance of what is now termed the 'Celtic Tiger' economy.
celtic	celtic	In Ireland, the Celtic Tiger economic boom has resulted in higher-paying, stable occupational opportunities for young professionals.
celtic	celtic	Unfortunately clouds are gathering over the EU's future: the paradoxical Irish vote (Ireland having become the 'Celtic Tiger' that we know thanks to EU funds), the government crisis in Austria, the statements of the Polish President, are all worrying signs.
celtic	celtic	Until 2007, the rest of Europe was amazed at the economic development of Ireland, the 'Celtic Tiger', which achieved dream economic data with low corporation taxes and little regulation.
celtic	celtic	I am also pleased that Parliament agrees on the need for recruiting the Celtic Sea as well as on the need for important cuts in fishing mortality through TAC and effort reductions.
celtic	celtic	To take up the point made by Mr Nicholson: why should young people in the Celtic Tiger economy in Ireland remain on the land?
celtic	celtic	The country dubbed the 'Celtic Tiger' once boasted remarkable levels of growth, but has been suffering from the impact of the crisis and the effects of globalisation over recent years.
celtic	None	The impoverished Emerald Isle has turned into a Celtic tiger. The EU has therefore been too hasty in issuing a warning to Ireland, since the situation of the country is being disregarded.
close	close_vrb	Officially, according to our agenda, we should close the debate at 11.50 a.m.
close	close_adj-nou	First of all, it ensures the close monitoring of radioactive waste and of the spent fuel, which is now being re-processed, without the application of unjustified restrictions and bans.
close	close_adj-nou	That is why we speak of the purpose of the political association, which must be to participate in the European Parliament. And finally, that is why it is stressed that the political party is not an extension of the parliamentary groups but an autonomous political body that operates close to the citizens, close to the grass roots.
close	close_vrb	Instead, I will focus on more recent developments. As you know, the Council decided to close the early-warning procedure as both countries reiterated their willingness to implement their stability programmes in full so as to avoid a breach of the 3% of GDP reference value and to resume the process of budgetary consolidation in order to reach their medium-term targets by 2004.
close	close_vrb	I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this.
close	close_vrb	I would like to close with a very fine slogan that you, Commissioner, mentioned at a recent event, when you said that we should use ‘Getting on Board’ as a slogan.
close	close_vrb	To close, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, for his qualitative contribution to the debate on international fair trade law.
close	close_vrb	In all events, I believe, to close, that if we do not make the Union operational, there is no point in debating further enlargement.
close	close_vrb	I close by saying the following.
close	close_adj-nou	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my special thanks to Mr Szenja, the rapporteur in the lead committee, for our close and fruitful cooperation.
close	close_adj-nou	"The text would then be worded as follows: ""Calls on the Member States, in close collaboration with the Commission services, to initiate a qualitative and quantitative revision"" ."
close	close_adj-nou	This will be done in close coordination with the various members of the Security Council and with EU Member States which are Security Council members, as well as the other Member States.
close	close_adj-nou	We ask it to do so in close collaboration with Italy, the country which initiated the campaign, and to associate with it not only the countries of the European Union but also all those that have shown willingness to be co-sponsors and co-authors.
close	close_adj-nou	If, as China has always claimed, the situation of the Tibetans is so wonderful, there would be neither grounds for flight nor justification for the fact that journalists, people from the West and observers have been prevented for months from visiting this country at all or only under close escort.
close	close_vrb	We must not close the doors to the few migrants worldwide that take the road to Europe.
close	close_vrb	It is high time we called on Mr Obama to close down this disgrace and spare us the reproach of such hypocrisy.
close	close_adj-nou	I myself would have willingly stayed in my office to have the pleasure of seeing him close-up on my television screen.
close	close_adj-nou	– Decabromodiphenylether is a brominated flame retardant well known to Parliament: in February 2003, it was placed ‘under close surveillance’ and, at the same time, the European Union, in a report of which I was the author, banned its two ‘sister’ substances, penta and octa BDE.
close	close_adj-nou	The 11 January 1997 issue of the British Medical Journal (Volume 314, pages 101-106) published a detailed article on the measured occurrence of leukaemia in young people living close to the nuclear reprocessing plant operated by COGEMA at La Hague on the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy.
close	close_adj-nou	New attacks on citizen's rights, freedoms and guarantees are on the horizon, including the travellers' registration programme, and this is a matter for close attention and active concern.
close	close_adj-nou	Just take a close look at that: in 2005, according to the Caveri report, even category 0 and 1 heavy goods vehicles are to be banned from passing through.
close	close_adj-nou	These are events that we have witnessed from relatively close-by in Chechnya.
close	close_adj-nou	I hope that the initiatives you have taken will help to achieve that, and I can tell Mr Schulz that people in Aachen, which is so close to the border, know perfectly well just how uncompetitive German legislation is even in North Rhine Westphalia.
close	close_adj-nou	– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike certain fellow Members, I think that Parliament is welcoming and feels close to the Moldovan people and in particular to their efforts to put in place a complete democratic system and achieve greater civil progress.
close	close_adj-nou	This is as contradictory as the 'federation of nation-States' of Jacques Delors, of whom the principal author of the White Paper is a close associate.
close	close_adj-nou	If their accession were to be slower than that of their close neighbours it would have disastrous psychological and political consequences which are to be avoided at all costs.
close	close_adj-nou	(RO) Madam President, it is already well known that global hydrocarbon reserves are close to running out.
close	close_adj-nou	Besides, we live so close to one another that there is almost no barrier to our understanding of each other already.
close	close_adj-nou	And once again we draw the same lesson: the citizens must keep a close guard on their powers and only delegate them where necessary to transparent institutions, devoted to their defence and over which they have full control.
close	close_vrb	"I should like to close by thanking the rapporteur for his sterling work and his willingness to cooperate during the procedure to examine and supplement his report in committee and I should like to pass on to you this succinct and, to my mind, rather dramatic appeal by a farmer in my region. As he said so very simply yet so very forcefully on hearing of the achievements of our Union: ""Europe yes, but a Europe for all the Europeans of the Union"" ."
close	close_vrb	To close, Mr Bush is coming, but he will have a macabre escort, the hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians murdered.
combine	combine_vrb	However, I am certain that the need for a coordinated intervention that will combine joint action at European level with the facility and ability of the Member States to improve their efficiency now constitutes common ground.
combine	combine_vrb	In the same way it really makes no sense at all - and I would ask you to remember this in future - always to combine the subject of human rights with the question of the external integrity of the Peoples' Republic of China, in which things are demanded for Tibet which even the Dalai Lama does not ask for!
combine	combine_vrb	Finally, and before giving the floor to our winners and their representatives I would like to combine the thoughts of Voltaire and Brecht. Two intellectuals separated by many years.
combine	combine_vrb	In our new policy framework we tried to combine the different levels of intervention needs in terms of both prevention and care, and even cure in the cases of malaria and tuberculosis, and in terms of country, regional, international or global level.
combine	combine_vrb	Baroness Ashton has the dubious honour of being the first EU official to combine a career in the Commission with a position in the Council of Ministers.
combine	combine_vrb	We could combine both topics. We could discuss the Afghan refugees under the 'human rights' heading and foot-and-mouth disease under a separate heading in the topical and urgent debate.
combine	combine_vrb	Finally, I should like to ask you, if that is what the strategy is like, how do you intend to combine it with improving relations with the newly elected Israeli Government, whatever form that may take?
combine	combine_vrb	Fourthly, I should like to underline that one of the secrets to the success of this project is being able to duly combine security and freedom, freedom of movement, much more freedom of movement, with appropriate data protection.
combine	combine_vrb	We do not want to see any repetitions of the scenes that have been shown on television in recent days: so many innocent victims, killed through a total inability to tackle the emergency and to know how to combine security and respect for human lives.
combine	combine_vrb	The European Union must combine its strategic partnership with China with work to persuade the Chinese authorities to expand political and personal freedoms in the Chinese system and to truly observe the constitution and international treaties to which China is a signatory.
combine	combine_vrb	We can and must be able to combine new technologies, steps to promote jobs and social development.
combine	combine_vrb	Social principles, technological viability and the context in which methods are applied are all of great importance to sustainability; the first principle of sustainability is to know how to combine general principles with the imposed rules to suit the needs of each community, each location, each climate and each context.
combine	combine_vrb	Secondly, I am delighted to hear that you would like to combine openness and protection in the services directive.
combine	combine_vrb	How to combine the Parliament’s annual budgetary compartmentalisation with the EDF’s five-year budget?
combine	combine_vrb	It is therefore our responsibility to safeguard the future of Europe's fruit and vegetable growers by creating a safety net with the aid of targeted assistance in order to combine sustainable production with high quality and a healthy environment.
combine	combine_vrb	I think that the message of Spain is clear to us, and we share this message: Europe will be either social or not at all; Europe will be either a global player or not at all; Europe will either be able to combine solidarity with subsidiarity or it will fail; Europe will either be able to offer a model of sustainable growth or it will vanish; Europe will either able to offer a solution in favour of social inclusiveness, gender equality and popular empowerment or it will fall apart; Europe will be able to associate multiculturalism with civic cohesion, free competition with generosity, efficiency with justice and flexibility with security, or it will become meaningless.
combine	combine_vrb	This attempt to combine the various aspects of the problem and handle them together has to begin with the acknowledgement of a fact known to us all: 60% of migrants arriving in Europe come by sea, and 'Fortress Europe' has issued an approximate estimate, by default, that 12 000 human beings have drowned or otherwise gone missing over the past ten years.
combine	combine_vrb	Will it finally combine forces in order to participate in the speedy, accurate implementation of the UN Peace Plan for Western Sahara (which provides for the holding of a referendum on self-determination), as called for in paragraph 6 of Parliament' s March 2000 resolution?
combine	combine_vrb	If we look at the European Union, we find something that has not been discussed today that there are many cases in which men's, and especially women's, desires with regard to having children cannot be fulfilled because this is so difficult to combine with a demanding professional life and a busy life in general.
combine	combine_vrb	So it is even more important to manage the crisis in a rational way, but also to adopt a course which leads to our desired goals: namely to combine agricultural policy goals with consumer protection, animal welfare, and environmental protection objectives.
combine	combine_vrb	The combination of work and care still presents problems in many cases, not only for women but also for men wishing to combine work and care.
combine	combine_vrb	In short, we require consistent policy choices that combine solidarity and responsibility, enabling us to offer a balanced response to an emergency that is otherwise in danger of getting out of hand.
combine	combine_vrb	I also suggest, Mr Van Rompuy, that you combine your political influence with that of President Buzek so that we may invite President Obama to come and address our European Parliament.
combine	combine_vrb	Averroës was a brilliant scholar but, at the same time, he was a symbol of failure - the result of trying to combine Greek philosophy with Islam.
combine	combine_vrb	Mr President, the Bourlanges report is both outstanding and technical, two qualities which are, more often than not, virtually impossible to combine in a single document.
combine	combine_vrb	(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal aimed to bring about simplification, to combine the two previous regulations into one: and it has done so.
combine	combine_vrb	The background was quite simply that we had a number of resolutions which we wished to combine in a single instrument with similar rules with regard to labour, sole-traders, students, post-graduate students, family members and immigrants who are permanently resident in the Union.
combine	combine_vrb	We must combine our instruments at European level with coordinated efforts in the Member States.
combine	combine_vrb	I congratulate Mr Brinkhorst for his efforts to include all interests in his decisions and I feel we have developed areas where agriculture interests and budget interests can combine to negotiate with the Commission and with the Council when they attend.
combine	combine_vrb	It was and is only right and proper that we combine in the fight against terrorism around the world, whether in New York, or Madrid, London or Jakarta.
compound	compound_vrb	Let us not compound that error by undervaluing biogas.
compound	compound_nou	However, it was agreed that the committee's pharmacovigilance working party would investigate if there was a safety issue with this compound.
compound	compound_nou	Beef farmers in Northern Ireland were also caught up in this problem because they imported the compound feed which caused the problem in their animals.
compound	compound_nou	Apart from the radiation, DU is a chemical toxic compound.
compound	compound_nou	Our intention was to amend as well the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight.
compound	compound_nou	I therefore think that it is positive that an agreement has been reached with the Council and the Commission that the maximum levels shall not apply to certain substances where a compound food contains no added flavourings and the only food ingredients with flavouring properties which have been added are fresh, dried or frozen herbs and spices.
compound	compound_nou	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a Directive seeks to limit volatile organic compound emissions, or VOCs, emissions which occur due to the use of organic solvents - which are themselves volatile organic substances - in many industrial activities.
compound	compound_nou	The addition of biofuels enables immediate reduction in pollution thanks to their zero sulphur compound content and their capacity to improve combustion.
compound	compound_nou	But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.
compound	compound_nou	Unfortunately, it is precisely these that are frequently counterfeited and often contain no active substance apart from sugar and the tablet compound.
compound	compound_nou	Mr President, my group supports the rapporteur's call for clarity and transparency with regard to the circulation of compound feedingstuffs.
compound	compound_nou	As the rapporteur states, it is important that the manufacturer of compound feedingstuffs, or whoever is responsible for labelling, provides a detailed list of all the raw materials used. The compulsory definition of acceptable raw materials in compound feedingstuffs for animals is also crucial, bearing the BSE and dioxin crises in mind.
compound	compound_nou	Circulation of compound feedingstuffs (debate)
compound	compound_nou	. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend my thanks - which will be passed on, I am sure - to the rapporteur for his work, but I regret that the Commission has not accepted the proposal for a decision of Parliament amending the Directive of 2002 on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs.
compound	compound_nou	I should like to use this debate on additives in animal nutrition as an opportunity to remind the House that the feeding of farm animals using compound feeds produced industrially is not, fortunately, the norm.
compound	compound_nou	Mr President, this report is on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and therefore on what animals eat, and animals include fish.
compound	compound_nou	The next item is the report (A5-0421/2001) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the European Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC (PE-CONS 3653/2001 - C5-0491/2001 - 2000/0015(COD)).
compound	compound_nou	I believe I am correct in saying that the issue of public health and food safety is related to the presence rather than the quantity of what is contained in the compound feedingstuff.
compound	None	To compound matters there were communication problems because of the natural language barriers.
compound	compound_vrb	Reductions in social programmes and services would compound the problem for those who are experiencing an erosion in their purchasing power.
compound	None	We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.
compound	None	The discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have revealed a great variety of opinions, especially on the open declaration for compound feedingstuffs.
compound	None	Yesterday, we discussed the circulation of compound feedingstuffs; today, at a second reading, we are back with undesirable substances in animal nutrition.
compound	compound_nou	During the construction work several workers using Rhoca-Gil sealing compound suffered damage to the nervous system and are at increased risk of cancer.
compress	compress	I have to tell you very frankly that it is extremely difficult for me to compress all my arguments, or at least my main arguments, into one minute, especially because most of the time I am not speaking my own language.
compress	None	We cannot compress five days' work into a Wednesday just because some people want to work for one day and have six days off every week.
compress	compress	A realistic timetable for implementation is five years, any attempt to compress that time will result in spiralling costs.
compress	compress	Any attempt to compress this time will result in spiralling costs - if not quite as much as Mrs Jackson says.
confines	confines_vrb	"Because the joint motion for a resolution refuses to acknowledge the correlation between cases of cancer and leukaemia in soldiers who served in the occupying forces in Bosnia and Kosovo and during the Gulf War and depleted uranium, it confines itself to a wish list of transparent discussions and working parties and merely calls for the Member States who are members of ÍÁÔÏ to propose that the use of depleted uranium weapons be stopped and for ÍÁÔÏ to study the possibility of using different types of weapons, in other words to continue killing, but with ""clean"" weapons."
confines	confines_vrb	The European Parliament’s resolution concerning the huge mortality rate for bees is fairly disappointing for, once more, it confines itself to evoking only a possible link between these phenomena and the use of certain pesticides, Gaucho and Regent, for the treatment of seeds.
confines	confines_vrb	The Commission itself accepts that the shortcomings of the system are not sufficient to motivate an urgent amendment of the decision on own resources and confines itself to putting forward alternative solutions to addressing the problem of financial imbalances, which was raised by some Member States.
confines	confines_vrb	As for the Middle East, the summit confines itself to a few general pronouncements on a Palestine state and talks of stopping the violence, without making any reference to Israeli aggression.
confines	confines_vrb	Secondly, the US rejects the dispute settlement procedure and confines itself to a simple consultation mechanism, which is obviously insufficient.
confines	confines_nou	The Seppänen report on forest-based and related industries is a step in the right direction, endeavouring as it does to overcome the confines of commercial competitiveness and create wider and deeper prospects for European forests.
confines	confines_nou	It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.
confines	confines_vrb	. The report confines the national parliaments to a role of scrutinising their respective governments, a role which has been curtailed ever since the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council broke the link between European decisions and those taken by each people separately.
confines	confines_vrb	By introducing new issues such as climate change, biofuels, water resources and risk management, the Commission has demonstrated its wish to move forward, even though some ambiguity still surrounds the way in which conditionality is to be handled, if it confines itself to laying down a generic requirement for simplification without clarifying how - and to what end - it is to be implemented.
confines	confines_nou	In the course of tomorrow' s debate, I should like us, on the basis of what many of our fellow MEPs have said today, to be able to agree upon at least one amendment, namely that, within the confines of this Parliament, no MEP may make racist remarks.
confines	confines_nou	Last week at the Le Bourget Salon we had the opportunity to hear about the commitment of the space agencies and European industry in the field of satellite transmission. In May, in Cairo, in the presence of Commissioner Bangemann, we sought to put on the agenda the initial elements of a plan for application of the information society via satellite with a view to a cooperation which goes beyond the confines of today's Union.
confines	confines_nou	This opens horizons for the future which will extend our project even beyond the geographical confines of our continent.
confines	confines_nou	I believe that this is an important illustration of how influential the European Union is, and that it is an important example of a case where our efforts have helped the position of women in a context broader than the confines of Europe.
confines	confines_nou	Over the past few years, we have seen a rise in extremism in Europe, an increase in outpourings of poisonous invective. We must be vigilant in defending the rights of everyone, a vigilance that must even extend into the confines of our own Parliament.
confines	confines_vrb	Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.
confines	confines_vrb	So this report confines itself to the question of Turkey's participation in the education and training programmes.
confines	confines_vrb	The contamination of the water table in the Asopos River region with hexavalent chromium from unmonitored industrial activity highlights the substantial shortcomings in the legislation, which confines itself to setting the upper limit for chromium content and makes no provision for such a demonstrably dangerous carcinogen.
confines	confines_vrb	Barbarity has reached an unbearable level: 60, 000 people have been massacred and the Algerian Government confines itself to eradicating terrorism by answering violence with violence.
confines	confines_vrb	Obviously, this report confines itself to a limited scope - as Mrs Lindeperg has pointed out - but there can be little doubt that its conclusions can be extrapolated to any form of fundamentalism.
confines	confines_vrb	If the Commission then confines itself to supervising abuses within the context of this changed system, then that is something which, to my mind, is highly questionable.
confines	confines_vrb	This proposal confines itself to merely codifying the existing texts, without any change in their substance.
confines	confines_nou	This is about as much as we can hope for within the confines of the common fisheries policy.
confines	confines_nou	All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.
confines	confines_nou	Madam President, Madam President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the increasing sophistication of international crime means that the efforts to combat it within the confines of individual countries are becoming insufficient.
confines	confines_nou	They will be more horizontal in approach, offering greater added value, and will provide opportunities for the EU and its Member States to work together far more effectively on health issues in the broader sense within the confines of the Treaty.
confines	confines_nou	Concerning the issue of special trade measures, which was raised by one of the honourable Members of this House, we are determined to take Pakistan’s trade interests into account within the confines of our international obligations.
confines	confines_vrb	In order to address this unacceptable situation, which condemns one billion people to malnourishment and starvation, the report confines itself to wish lists which are cancelled out by its insistence on abiding by the same policy: support for the common agricultural policy and its reviews and 'health check', the completion of negotiations in the World Trade Organization, the decoupling of aid from production and the continuing production of biofuels, on the pretext of the environment and using land which could be used to produce food.
conflict	conflict_nou	We welcome the request made in the report for compensation to be paid to civilian victims of an unequal conflict and for the International Criminal Court to be seized of any cases in which the parties fail to conduct genuinely independent and impartial investigations, as was requested last January by numerous Israeli human rights associations.
conflict	conflict_nou	The two populations are heartily sick of the conflict and want nothing more than a solution to the dispute.
conflict	conflict_nou	The conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts arose from the attempts of past governments to settle part of their expanding populations in the area in total disregard of the rights of the indigenous people, without respect for the autonomy which they once enjoyed.
conflict	conflict_nou	I shall also endeavour to restate once again the position we are endeavouring to defend on behalf of the European Union regarding this dramatic conflict.
conflict	conflict_nou	I would urge the parties to the conflict in the strongest terms to seize this unique opportunity to resolve this unfortunate conflict.
conflict	conflict_nou	Despite the obvious differences within the European Union, there are certain things which I believe, now more than ever, we are obliged to do together. We must increase our efforts to contribute to the search for peace in the Middle East, and to eliminate the points of tension in the Maghreb and, of course, provide humanitarian aid during the conflict and then assist in the human, political and economic reconstruction of the country afterwards, as the Presidency of the Union has pointed out.
conflict	conflict_nou	Our commitment is to safeguard the friendship which binds the European Union and Tunisia while consolidating the existing relationship, including in view of the conflict which could arise concerning the idea of an advanced status for that country.
conflict	conflict_nou	This conflict must not go on for too long, because the damage done increases with every day that passes.
conflict	conflict_nou	Since the end of military conflict – 30 years ago the war in Vietnam was coming to a close – and the fall of bloody communist regimes – such as that of Pol Pot – or violent anti-government – as in Laos – the international community has been actively cooperating towards supporting former Indochina in terms of development and democracy within the international forum.
conflict	conflict_nou	However, I do not believe that the Hungarian Presidency has truly understood the conflict.
conflict	conflict_nou	I can only agree with Mr Lagendijk that 'conflict prevention implies stronger commitment and political direction on the part of the Member States, as the Community instruments alone are not enough to resolve all possible sources of conflict'.
conflict	conflict_nou	Europe's monetary concerns are in conflict with the economic and budgetary sovereignty of the Member States.
conflict	conflict_nou	Human rights must be respected by all sides in the Middle East conflict.
conflict	conflict_nou	When conflict is a thing of the past, it is important to recognise that a peace settlement would transform everybody's prospects.
conflict	conflict_nou	Must we risk years of conflict, of turf wars, of duplication of effort before we recognise the sense of this approach?
conflict	conflict_nou	Impressions brought back from Minsk on the conflict mentioned, as well as on Belarus's participation in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, could shift EU relations with Belarus in a better direction.
conflict	conflict_nou	For its part, the European Union must take decisive steps to resolve the issue of Transnistria, and increased dialogue between the EU and Moldova can help to resolve this long-standing conflict and to stabilise the situation in this region of Europe.
conflict	conflict_nou	Firstly, I would like to share the concern about the continuing conflict and political instability in Somalia.
conflict	conflict_nou	Generally, terrorism is found in areas of conflict resolution where unfortunately many of those involved believe in what they are doing.
conflict	conflict_nou	Mr President, peace in the Middle East hinges on a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and on the entire European policy concerning strategic partnership.
conflict	conflict_nou	Now that, sadly, the conflict has flared up again, we cannot be content to seek a return to the previous fragile status quo, but must seize this tragic opportunity to resolve the fundamental problems, and in accordance with the UN resolutions.
conflict	conflict_nou	However, the previous, comprehensive European Parliament resolution, which called on international bodies to impose sanctions and block the economic activities stoking the flames of the conflict, produced no results.
conflict	conflict_nou	Finally, we must not only applaud the fact that no Israeli flags were burnt during the recent events in Egypt, but also observe that the lack of a long-due solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the origin of the feeling of failure which upset Arab society and fuelled its neurosis.
conflict	conflict_nou	Unfortunately, he paid a high price for his noble and unselfish involvement in the Burundi conflict when he was murdered by rebel groups on 29 December 2003.
conflict	conflict_nou	The less amusing aspect of the conflict we are engaged in today is that there are several hundred delegates sitting here who are actually willing to accept this without protest!
conflict	conflict_nou	Therefore, pressure is needed - international pressure, including from the European Union - on both sides of the conflict so that they will resume talks and try to resolve their dispute by political means, and not through violence.
conflict	conflict_nou	But I would point out to my British colleague that he agreed with the UK government that Article 234 of the Treaty did in fact render this conflict invalid.
conflict	conflict_nou	Since the conflict in Libya began, I have suggested that the international community should put all its energies into supporting the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime.
conflict	conflict_nou	European Union policy is therefore based on the view that the results of the Great Lakes conflict must be dealt with in their three main dimensions: regional, bearing in mind the interests of the neighbouring countries; national, taking account of the interests of the government, rebel groups and democratic opposition; and local, concerning community clashes due to ethnic rivalries and severe social pressures.

conflict	conflict_nou	Another cause, as I see it, is that sources of conflict, are imported as a result of excessive immigration, where what happens is that disputes which normally take place in the immigrants' home countries are transplanted into the countries to which they have migrated, and of course these migratory movements are also exploited by organized crime.
conflict	conflict_nou	The idea of the European Union's foreign and security policy being a means of conflict prevention and of enhancing international security is in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter, and making such a common foreign policy the precondition for the development of a European defence policy - the need for which is self-evident - is a cause of controversy in this House, even though it has been apparent since as recently as the Kosovo conflict that the European Union must have the capacity to perform tasks establishing and maintaining peace, as it is already doing in Macedonia.
conflict	conflict_nou	Furthermore, I support the actions carried out in the areas which come under the European Union's guidelines, relating specifically to the promotion of democracy, human rights, the death penalty, torture, children's rights, violence against women and armed conflict.
conflict	conflict_nou	Rather than seek an artificial unification of all rules of law, she achieves unification by proposing a harmonisation of the rules governing the conflict of laws and jurisdiction – which is the correct approach – in order to determine which law is to apply, and this makes it possible to combine the package of national rules with the demands of legal certainty.
conflict	conflict_nou	If, as we all hope, a peace agreement is reached, the experience gained from decades of conflict resolution in such situations shows that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to do without the services of peacekeeping troops if the incidents that inevitably happen under such conditions, because local warlords are incapable of accepting peace, are not to degenerate into conflagration.
conflict	conflict_vrb	President Santer presumed to claim that the convergence criteria of monetary union do not conflict with the requirement of full employment.
conflict	conflict_nou	I believe, therefore, that the proposed amendment is quite representative of the conflict that we have here.
conjugate	None	And therefore, as many previous speakers have during this festive season, I would like to express the wish that the European summit will one day learn, in as many languages as you like, to understand, appreciate, state, perhaps even conjugate much better, on the threshold of the 21st Century, one little word which is no longer established in poetry alone but in politics as well. That word is 'woman' .
conjugate	conjugate_vrb	We therefore urgently need to take account of this problem and to conjugate the various austerity plans adopted by the European Union and its Member States in the feminine too.
conscript	conscript_nou	- (NL) Mr President, on 25 June 2006, an Israeli Army conscript, Corporal Gilad Shalit, was abducted following a terrorist infiltration from the Gaza Strip.
conscript	conscript_nou	Very briefly, the other points I would mention in respect of Russia are the situation in the Russian army, in particular in Chechnya, but also internally because the Russian army is notorious these days for the cruelty which it exerts and in particular the treatment of its young conscript soldiers.
conscript	conscript_vrb	Consider, for example, the tragic child-soldier system. 'It is a good idea to conscript children because they do the same job as adults but they are difficult for the enemy army to see', one official had the courage to say.
construct	construct_vrb	Now, in a new era, with the Cold War over, we have the chance to construct a security policy without nuclear weapons.
construct	construct_vrb	Still, on this total uncertainty over the electorate we wish to construct a criterion or a castle that has its own internal consistency - apart from the basis or foundation - and this will give us a composition that in no way respects pre-existing realities or the citizens.
construct	None	The European Commission is pursuing its efforts to construct an area of unbridled global free trade in which the workers of the South, with no competitive advantage but their poverty, are used as a weapon against the workers of the northern hemisphere.
construct	None	Not necessarily of course research in predicting earthquakes, a practice which has been proven to have limitations, but research in the way we construct our buildings.
construct	construct_nou	This is not political romanticism. It is respect for the principles on which the European construct was founded: the principles of equality and solidarity.
construct	construct_nou	The people's interest lies in opposition, in breaking with the anti-grassroots policy of the EU and the European Parliament which supports it and in overturning the euro-unifying construct.
construct	construct_nou	It furthermore rules out the sui generis construct.
construct	construct_nou	We were well aware that we were joining a community created by and composed of people and not some sort of ideal construct developed without authentic human interests, ambitions, opinions and ideas.
construct	construct_nou	. – Mr President, the major question raised by my political group lies not solely in the policies for which specific provision is made for 2007, but also in the doubts which are being created in our mind in connection with the broader strategic direction being given to the European construct as a whole.
construct	construct_vrb	The danger is that we plan and construct on behalf of others, but do not create the conditions necessary for the peoples and countries of the Balkans to take control of their own destiny.
construct	construct_vrb	We are facing here an obstacle to freedom of movement because, if you punish citizens on their phone bill when they cross a border, that is frankly not the internal market we strive for and that we wish to construct.
construct	construct_vrb	In more general terms, the high level group of experts on life sciences, recently established at my behest, must help us to construct a genuine dialogue on the life sciences between the world of research and society at large.
construct	construct_vrb	The Austrian BEGAS corporation is planning to construct a 325 000-tonne-capacity waste incinerator just a few hundred metres from the Hungarian border, at Heiligenkreuz.
construct	construct_vrb	I do not share these views, because, in terms of vehicle construction, you know very well that it takes years to design and construct cars. Mr Davies, you know this.
construct	construct_vrb	We need now really to stop making the same demands of poor countries as we make of rich ones and to help construct healthy and strong states in the developing countries which can then embrace the right to share the ownership of development policy.
construct	construct_vrb	Today, many of the warning lights are red; they are telling us that it is time to reform this regulation and to construct a true common asylum system founded on solidarity and responsibility.
construct	construct_vrb	Children must always be at the heart of how we construct our society, at the same time as the family is society’s most important and most fundamental building block.
construct	construct_vrb	. (PT) To pursue the reasoning behind my intervention in the debate, I wish to emphasise that this report can only be supported enthusiastically by those who share the basic philosophy of the rapporteur, most candidly expressed when he spoke to us here on this very issue on 14 March 2000, saying 'The Charter represents an opportunity to construct a modern post-national society'.
construct	construct_vrb	Romania and Bulgaria, as well as the other countries concerned, are making considerable efforts to construct this railway line so that eventually their respective capitals and the port of Constanza will be linked to the rail network of the rest of the European Union.
construct	construct_vrb	Finally, the fact that the trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, which are undoubtedly very complex, have broken down also offers the European Union various opportunities to integrate more innovative elements into bilateral agreements and to try to construct new types of trade agreements which further integrate the EU's objectives with regard to the environment, climate, human rights or social rights.
construct	construct_vrb	We should all remember that the financial and human effort needed to construct today's Union was the most efficient investment ever made on such a scale by countries of a whole continent.
construct	construct_vrb	I think that, alongside efforts by industry to construct this demonstration plant, the Member States need to make an effort to get national legislation transposing this directive under way.
construct	construct_vrb	The core objective is to extend the business activity of capital and construct a system in which public-sector health services operate on private-sector criteria, in competition with the private sector.
construct	construct_vrb	I wish to say briefly that I think the European Parliament has made a good choice and the European Union has a worthy representative in the European Ombudsman, because really and truly Mr Söderman has constructed and is still trying tirelessly to construct this invaluable instrument.
construct	construct_vrb	But it will be essential if we are to construct a consistent, serious and effective parliamentary institution, in the service of democracy and transparency in Europe.
construct	construct_vrb	Mr Aznar, we must construct an area of freedom, justice and security for the citizens, while fully respecting the democratic traditions of our countries and the fundamental human rights embodied in our Charter.
construct	construct_vrb	The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.
construct	construct_vrb	Now when Russia and Germany nevertheless construct a gas pipeline on the seabed directly between their two countries, they do this to isolate themselves.
construct	construct_vrb	With this regulation, we are helping to construct the European home, in this case in a virtual form.
construct	construct_vrb	It is very important in my view, therefore, that when we come to construct a joint external service, we make sure that we combine the strengths of both Pillar I and Pillar II in the management and implementation of CFSP.
construct	construct_vrb	My life would be far easier if I were able to construct a sports policy on the basis of an article in the Treaty.
construct	construct_vrb	The Commission, together with the Council and the European Parliament, must construct this scoreboard and macroeconomic and macrofinancial indicators intended for Member States.
construct	construct_vrb	The alternative would be to construct a sturdy and efficient public welfare sector and to strengthen democracy.
content	None	I must say on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries that in general we are satisfied with the content of the budget: we are won over by the approach to international agreements; we are content that the specific operation in favour of small-scale fisheries and coastal fishing has been maintained; above all, we are certain that Parliament's efforts in respect of small-scale fisheries have facilitated the establishment of projects which create employment, especially for young people, as well as land-based assistance for fishermen.
content	content_adj-nou-vrb	Europe has in the main been content to stand by, merely stammering a vague protest about the incidents around the Estonian embassy in Moscow.
content	content_nou	Lastly, the discussions in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the content of the excellent draft legislative resolution presented by Mr Watson confirm the feeling that there is at present a clear divergence - as you know and as was evident this morning - between the expectations of the European Parliament and the capacity of the Council to reach unanimous agreement.
content	content_nou	Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my generally negative view of the report presented by Mrs Figueiredo, since its content runs counter to the economic and social policy advocated by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
content	content_nou	It also strengthens the demands relating to the content of the projects to be presented.
content	content_nou	In some cases it will depend on the form of the proposals, given our commitment to subsidiarity; in others, it will depend on their exact content.
content	content_nou	The first part of this initiative, namely the communication of 30 September 2005, was based on three main aspects: digitisation, online access and preservation of digital content.
content	content_nou	Although I do not agree entirely with some of the points made in the report, and whilst I would change the order of priorities in some cases, I welcome the thrust of its content, because its guiding principles are close to mine on this issue.
content	content_nou	Mr President, there are mainly two elements of relevance here: one is content and the other is procedure.
content	content_nou	We can ensure that their content is clearer for farmers, but also for the national or regional authorities which implement and monitor them.
content	content_nou	Mr President, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, like other groups, my group has already given its opinion on the content of the British Presidency's programme but I would also like to pass in review some of the points which seem to me significant.
content	content_nou	on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the review of the previous legislation - which is seen as a natural legal adjustment to new technologies - conceals a desire for the uncontrolled liberalisation of the advertising market: no daily limit on teleshopping, telepromotions that are not included in the schedule, unregulated small advertising spots and the introduction of product placement, an advertising practice that is so interwoven with programme content that it cannot be regulated either quantitatively or qualitatively.
content	content_nou	I believe there is still work to be done on the CAP reform and the content of this policy can and must be reformed.
content	content_nou	What we must do – beyond saying that the content is right but the practice is failing – is be consistent with the values that we state, both as a Union and as countries.
content	content_nou	Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Samuelsen has said, and, if we agree to this demand, to ask my colleagues to vote ‘yes’ rather than ‘no’ to Amendments 16 and 20, which have to do with the content rather than the name.
content	content_nou	In this light, the report on Content is extremely important, because it promotes an increase in productivity and innovation, better information products and services; it has a positive impact on Government, another area in which we are trailing behind badly, and it leads to more projects in the areas of Health, Business and Learning.
content	content_nou	It is, in fact, not so much the content of the present Treaty or present declarations which is at issue, in fact he is more concerned to adapt these declarations, presumably in such a way as to form a legal basis from them, so that a programme can be based on them.
content	content_nou	The proposal for a directive on retention of traffic data, which the Commission adopted on 21 September 2005, and which the Council considered in October, also concerns traffic data and not the content of communications.
content	content_nou	The question is then the content of Article 4(3) of the draft regulation, with reference precisely to the above-mentioned regions, for we believe that the method of determining the areas does not produce a wholly accurate definition of which areas are genuinely disadvantaged and that the Commission is aware of this.
content	content_nou	We had reached agreement in committee as regards the content of the compromise amendment but, because the formulation was not quite right, we came to an agreement on the following; paragraph 12, on which we have already voted, says exactly what has to be expressed here, and that is why, as rapporteur, I would propose that we vote against paragraph 43 and that those who have difficulty with this - and I would urge this strongly - should at least abstain.
content	content_nou	Whilst we do not share the rapporteur’s position, we do accept his conclusion that this Commission initiative must be rejected, given in particular that it defines neither the system nor its operation ‘including the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which they are to be entered and the criteria for their entry, the rules concerning the content of VIS records, the rights of access for authorities to enter, update and consult the data and rules on the protection of personal data and its control’.
content	content_nou	The actual content of the report would in fact significantly breach the civil liberties of citizens right across the EU, because the collection and passing-on of DNA data to other EU Member States becomes obligatory for the first time.
content	content_nou	In Portugal, the National Employment Plan transposes the content of the Strategy to the Portuguese situation in an attempt to respond to the new challenges.
content	content_nou	Furthermore, Madam President, as regards the content of this report, I think this proposal is appropriate and advisable, although we hope the provisions can also be applied to vessels in transit.
content	content_nou	Now a word to the PPE-DE: I admit we have a few motions here about whose content we can discuss.
content	content_nou	First, a revised Code of Conduct on the content and presentation of stability and convergence programmes was agreed in 2001 and implemented in the current round of programmes. This has helped improve the assessment of programmes and has also enabled us to consider the aggregate impact of budgetary targets for the euro area as a whole.
content	content_nou	In recent days we have once again suffered - as also happened during the committee procedure and as also happened in this House in the case of the Van Lancker report - the bombardment of our e-mail systems with messages which have always been threatening, aggressive, laden with insults and furthermore always, without exception, lacking in arguments or a rigorous analysis of the content of the report, which is solely attributed with the aim of imposing mass sterilisations, and I will read out a fragment of an e-mail I have received: 'If this report is approved, the European Union would become one of the major promoters of abortion and the culture of death, and its approval would mean accepting the annihilation of the poor'.
content	content_nou	For that reason, pointers and appeals to the Member States, as set out in the report, are more than justified from a European perspective, even though we have no direct powers in respect of the content and structure of education.
content	content_nou	Technology and content cannot be governed by the same legislation: technology must be neutral and content must be regulated.
content	content_nou	It will intervene in areas such as content that is potentially harmful to children, content that is unwanted by the final user and illegal content such as child pornography.
content	content_nou	Broad sections of the population having access to these new forms of knowledge and learning is something we should very much welcome. We should not forget, however, that in the long term, the wishes of equipment manufacturers and consumers can only be met if diversity of content is guaranteed.
content	content_nou	. (FR) This report, without commenting on content - the advantages for consumers of the ionisation process, which it does not contest - highlights a number of dangers and instances of abuse in this field.
content	content_nou	Without calling into question the importance of the work done by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2009 or its undeniable contribution to development cooperation, I cannot fail to express my concern about the content of point 6 of the Joly report: 'encourages the JPA to continue to work on this area and to explore additional and innovative sources of financing for development, such as an international financial transaction tax'.
content	None	The French chemicals firm Rhône-Poulenc, manufacturers of Rhoca-Gil sealing compound, stated before the accident that the acrylamide content of the ceiling compound was 1.5 %; it has since proved to be much higher.
content	content_nou	This is therefore about strategic choices, about the content of policy.
content	content_nou	Moreover, you have informed the House of the content of the letter sent to Mr Pasty.
contest	contest_nou	However, the European Union must not be prepared to take a back seat and watch as Iran becomes a player in the contest.
contest	None	I fail to see how the Commissioner can speak of different equality measures for women when she does not contest this strategy.
contest	contest_nou	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the best thing to do concerning our trade relations with China and Asian markets in general is to desist from an unequal contest that will cause irreparable damage to European industry: the textile industry today, manufacturing tomorrow, then the car industry, technology and so on.
contest	contest_vrb	This is not a sterile debate about principles; it is about practical measures to contest criminality and our opponents.
contest	contest_nou	Last year, the virtue contest between governments was about who could spend the most.
contest	contest_nou	I will mention the thresholds, which seem to give rise to a virtue contest, with the thresholds being set at the lowest levels possible; next, the assessment indicators of the ‘breeding contests’; and lastly, and above all, the impact study of the repercussions in terms of the elimination of farms and jobs in the sector.
contest	contest_nou	What we do not need is a beauty contest between leaders, a cacophony of diverging scenarios, or announcements that are not followed by action.
contest	contest_nou	Mr President, Turkey has won the Eurovision Song Contest, but has not yet scored enough points for the integration festival.
contest	contest_nou	I should also like to ask you to confirm that the closest the European Parliament has been to discussing whether these women should boycott the Miss World contest has been the discussion we had in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities when women were specifically called upon to boycott the Miss World contest.
contest	contest_nou	If we were simply balancing the health and safety of children against the needs and priorities of industry there would be no contest, but there are related issues which we should address.
contest	contest_nou	New cases of intimidation, arrests and also the uninvestigated disappearance of political rivals of the ruling party confirm to us that Robert Mugabe and his political party know that a fair and transparent political contest would strip them of power and raise the prospect of penalties for terrorising the population and pillaging the wealth of the country over many years.
contest	contest_nou	The G8 is becoming more and more of a beauty contest, and it is, of course, extremely sad to see the very concept being discredited by the participants' failure to honour the promises they repeat year after year.
contest	contest_vrb	I do not contest this figure.
contest	contest_vrb	We need to firmly oppose those who contest enlargement today with a strategy of political and social democratisation, peace, security and stability through the progress of the Balkans towards Europe.
contest	contest_vrb	So I would formally contest the statement by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
contest	contest_vrb	I should also like to firmly contest the Commission's approach as presented in its communication.
contest	contest_vrb	Nobody seriously continues to contest that the priority should be on growth for jobs.
contest	contest_vrb	Consequently, from my point of view, we need to contest the logic of those against prohibitions firmly for, with regard to synthetic drugs as well, they say that legalization would limit the harm, at least by eliminating illegal profits, as if the problem of drug dependency were only a problem of public order.
contest	contest_vrb	For over 26 years, the President has ruled over the archipelago as a dictator; only his own party is allowed to contest elections, he himself is the supreme judge, appoints one-sixth of the members of parliament, and controls the media, while economic life as a whole is in the hands of his family, something to which Mr Deva referred.
contest	contest_vrb	I therefore agree with the assessment made by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs stating that it is not the intention of the European Parliament to usurp implementing powers pertaining to the Commission: what it is actually seeking to do is to introduce a system that will enable it properly to exercise control and, if necessary, to contest an implementing measure with which it does not agree when this falls under the codecision procedure.
contest	contest_vrb	That is the practical situation, and I can assure all the representatives of parties which vote down the minority groups - those parties that decide here in this Chamber - that we shall do everything to contest this legal basis.
contest	contest_vrb	First, if we persist in holding these part-sessions in Brussels in November and December, will it not be possible for any person to contest the votes taken there before the Court if it is in their interest to do so?
contest	contest_vrb	We therefore contest this vote from every point of view. In our opinion, it is contrary to France's national interests.
contest	contest_vrb	It is a decision, then, which we are once again called upon to contest today, as we have already done previously, and as a large majority of Member States has also done previously; but the Commission has apparently showed an arrogant disregard for those protests, perhaps persuaded by market interests which have little in common with the interests of the consumer and of public health.
contest	contest_vrb	It is true that colonisation did have its darker side, but the fact remains that, even if we contest the borders which the colonial powers established, we still have to admit that they often brought an end to wars that pitted African nations one against the other.
contest	contest_vrb	If I may take the liberty to contest perhaps only one point, the threat of terrorism really has nothing to do with a democratic society - even though such societies are often the target of terrorist activity - but is a far more pervasive threat against all people, whatever the political conditions in which they live.
contest	None	In fact, during all this time, Captain Dadis Camara, who assumed power, has promised that he will drop out of the contest and not present himself as a candidate.
contest	contest_nou	Parliament cannot act as if it were in a 'grab as grab can' type of wrestling contest, in which the most unscrupulous party of all is the victor.
contest	contest_vrb	For this reason, I strongly contest that the adoption of Amendment No 14 should cause the other two, including our Amendment No 18, to lapse.
contest	None	There are even signs that Sunni Arabs are moving into politics and preparing to contest the election, such as the formation last week of the National Public Democratic Movement in the province of Anbar.
contest	contest_vrb	If he is a statesman, like Mandela, then he should step down with dignity and let someone else from Zanu-PF contest the election.
converse	converse_vrb	I would therefore be most interested to know how you managed to converse with him, Mr President.
converse	converse_vrb	My own father finds it difficult to converse with my infant son because of industrially-induced hearing loss.
converse	converse_vrb	I bid a warm welcome to Amira Dotan and the members of her delegation, with whom we have already had the opportunity - on Tuesday - to converse at greater length.
converse	converse_vrb	With regard to tax havens, you will converse in the language of your country with your own government and you will discover that you have work to do.
converse	converse_adj-nou	The second question is, in some respects, the converse of the first, and concerns Turkey’s political will to press forward whole-heartedly with the necessary reforms of its structures and its institutional and legal framework in order to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria, much as has occurred in the other candidate countries.
converse	converse_adj-nou	The European Union, by contrast, is founded on the converse principle.
converse	converse_adj-nou	The converse also applies.
converse	converse_adj-nou	I believe that the converse example is also valid: when an Englishman or Irishman commits a crime in my country, it should be possible to send him back.
converse	converse_adj-nou	The so-called 'liberalization' favoured by Blair's right wing caucus has hit the rock of French immoveability in relation to energy production in the domestic sector, so it remains the case that Electricité de France can take over companies outside France while protected from converse interventions.
convert	convert_vrb	Is it not also necessary that the Council take advantage of the provisions in the current Treaty to convert the hopelessly ineffective as well as undemocratic intergovernmental provisions in the law enforcement area to Community competence so that suitable enforcements of the law are agreed by the Member States?
convert	None	As concerns the Structural Funds, the Commission launched a programme in 1993, in the context of a crisis in the defence industry, called 'Konver'. This was an aid programme to convert the labour market areas most affected by the reduction in armament activities or the closure of military sites.
convert	convert_vrb	Apart from ongoing mercury emissions from MCCAPs, when these plants convert to mercury-free technologies, the vast quantities of mercury in their cells need to be managed in an environmentally appropriate manner.
convert	convert_vrb	This and what Turkey is seeking with its pillaging of the archaeological, religious and cultural heritage in Cyprus and its threat to convert the church of St. Sophia in Constantinople into a mosque are all of a piece.
convert	convert_vrb	In Turkey's case, it has much to do, including the legal status of religious groups and property rights, but fundamentally the right to worship freely and the right to convert must be respected.
convert	convert_vrb	For this reason, we should find contractual solutions that will enable us to convert the Transatlantic Declaration into a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement.
convert	convert_vrb	Priests are accused of forcing people to convert to Christianity by bribing them with money and jobs, for which they must be punished.
convert	convert_vrb	However I also regret very strongly the absence of the Council tonight, because I am afraid too many of us are preaching to the converted: it is the Council that we have to convert.
convert	convert_vrb	We need, through the different mechanisms - the Bureau, our committees, the Conference of Presidents - to convert that appetite for change into actual change on the floor of this House.
convert	convert_vrb	It is much the same with we Europeans when it comes to innovation: we are brilliant at inventing things, and we are brilliant when it comes to reaching the penalty area, but we cannot convert this into goals.
convert	convert_vrb	When one considers the structural weaknesses of its shipyards and, in general terms, the need to convert a protected and insular economy into an open market economy, the adoption of the EU’s was a great challenge and a major achievement for this small island state.
convert	convert_vrb	I was gratified today to receive an e-mail from a Swedish waste organisation (det svenska avfallsbolaget) which says that a pilot plant is now being constructed that can already handle 500 kg of waste and convert it to insoluble, solid form.
convert	convert_vrb	On the other hand, the problem will remain for the four Member States outside the euro zone, which will then be obliged to convert prices and amounts into the euro, under the scheme established by the CAP.
convert	convert_vrb	This is a huge problem for us in Ireland, because, if airlines were to convert free of charge, we would have to replace these Kyoto allowances by those that the Irish state would have to buy on the market at full market price.
convert	None	First and foremost, they have to convert their diversity from the weakness it has been hitherto into added value in order to start to exploit the genuine potential they offer.
convert	convert_vrb	European farmers will have to choose whether to convert their systems to use enriched cages - which are more spacious, to improve the animal's wellbeing - or to rear laying hens on the ground, outside, or in organic systems.
convert	convert_vrb	In conclusion, Mr President, I want to stress that the fifth framework programme could on the one hand continue to devote resources to research and technologies of combined utility, and on the other hand, help to convert defence-related industrial research installations.
convert	convert_vrb	I therefore believe that efforts to convert this industry must be redoubled, in order to guarantee jobs and the economic survival of producers in Portugal and all of the European tobacco-producing countries.
convert	convert_vrb	The plan of assistance which has been drawn up is also important because it should be possible to restructure the industry and encourage people to convert to other types of fishery.
convert	convert_vrb	On the other hand there is the question of financial equilibrium - Mr d'Aboville, or the Mayor of Luçon, was talking about this just now - the financial equilibrium of the sixty fishing undertakings, or the sixty vessels, of the Isle of Yeu, and all the problems that would arise from having to convert the fishing fleets.
convert	convert_vrb	If the owner has to make investments to convert his vessel in order to be able to use other fishing equipment, it is essential to take account of all the investment needed for this conversion, without having to apply an abatement coefficient linked to the age of the fishing vessel.
convert	None	Mr President, the requirements for agriculture to become environmentally-friendly and species-friendly are a matter of general knowledge; implementing them demands that we convert to methods of cultivation, rearing and feeding that are as close to nature as possible.
convert	convert_vrb	The Council hopes to convert this priority into figures with a total appropriation 30% higher than in 2000.
convert	convert_vrb	If we convert that into concrete measures, then some painful decisions will have to be made, and national governments will then have to stand by these decisions.
convert	convert_vrb	Madam President, these islands are very windy and there were devices which convert wind energy into electricity.
convert	None	In the same way, while it is legitimate to aim to eliminate special tax arrangements and convert them into regional aid, it should not be forgotten that countries such as Ireland benefited a great deal from them until recently and that as the economic level of the Eastern regions concerned is particularly low, it will not be possible to create viable companies straight away.
convert	convert_vrb	It must convert economic competition into genuine emulation to promote freedom, democracy, the principle of legality, social justice, respect for human rights, environmental protection and the peaceful coexistence of nations and individuals.
convert	convert_vrb	Secondly, farmers prepared to convert their existing livestock housing or build new housing in such a way as to appreciably improve animal welfare, will receive more investment support than others.
convert	convert_vrb	in writing. - (PT) As neither the Treaty proposal nor this proposal to adopt by qualified majority decisions on regulations relating to the structure, operations, field of action and tasks of Europol have been ratified, the EU institutions are already tiring of trying to convert the European Police Office into a European agency.
convert	convert_vrb	It is this which can mobilise the world' s huge need for food and convert it into a level of demand with great purchasing power.
convert	convert_vrb	If this House wishes to convert the EU from a customs union with political pretensions into a modern effective free trade area, it will have my full support.
convert	convert_vrb	There are numerous alibis: the ageing of the population in order to increase retirement ages, energy security in order to privatise the energy sector and convert it from a social to a commercial commodity, reduction in deficits as required under the Stability Pact by 'containing' public spending on grass-roots requirements and salary/productivity links in order to safeguard reductions in wages and pensions.
convert	convert_vrb	Although many, but not all, NGO's and also many States strenuously attempted to convert the Conference into a unilateral forum of condemnation of Israel and to make the issue of slavery and colonialism an opportunity for demanding compensation payments, it can be counted a success that the Final Document did not take up extreme positions of this sort and that it came into being at all.
convert	convert_vrb	Where Europe falls down is in the ability to convert this tradition, this knowledge, into opportunities for growth, above all by improving the links between the academic world and the world of production.
convert	convert_vrb	This does not mean that I believe that agrifuels are the panacea, because the energy balance is negative and because that gives rise to speculation, but we must try to convert material which is actually available, as waste, into energy.
convert	convert_vrb	I consider it necessary to check whether it is possible to convert to other agricultural products and, thirdly, to check how and if the livelihood of many farmers and many thousands of families can nevertheless be secured.
convict	convict_vrb	Vice-President/High Representative, let the EU lead on efforts to hold accountable individuals who rape women before execution so that there is absolutely no chance they may end up in heaven as virgins, men who shoot dead unarmed youths from rooftops while they walk in the streets, and the judges who convict human rights lawyers for defending juveniles and women.
convict	None	It is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94% of the cases brought to court.
convict	convict_vrb	Four or five very hard criminals may be given soft sentences to convict one.
convict	convict_vrb	Mrs Győri, I am familiar with a principle in criminal law which states: 'Better 10 guilty men go free than to convict a single innocent'.
convict	convict_vrb	Extra-territorial legislation to convict those who travel abroad to abuse children is absolutely vital.
convict	convict_vrb	Therefore, given the scale of the crime that has been committed against whole civilian populations, it is crucial that we investigate, try and convict the leaders responsible for this crime against humanity, and immediately ban the manufacture, testing, use and sale of this type of weapon containing depleted uranium, not simply approve a moratorium.
convict	convict_vrb	To conclude, if Europe wishes to protect the health and safety of consumers, it must track down and convict fraudsters, as it has done, but also ban the marketing of consumer products containing dangerous substances such as CMR substances and endocrine disruptors.
convict	convict_vrb	That principle is that we need to use intelligence effectively and intelligently to target, track down, identify and convict the criminals who, through terrorist violence and serious and organised crime, threaten the security and strength of our society.
convict	convict_vrb	Will the Commission convict the people who use the tools of the state for party political and even personal interests?
convict	convict_vrb	in writing. - With this resolution the EP: 1. reaffirms its belief that Russia remains an important partner for the European Union in building sustainable cooperation based on democracy and rule of law; 2. strongly condemns the terrorist attack at Moscow's Domodedovo airport and expresses its condolences to the families of the victims and its solidarity with those wounded in the attack; underlines the need for the Russian authorities to respond to this attack in a lawful and measured way and to allow the Russian judicial system to work freely and independently to prosecute and convict those responsible for the attack; 3. expresses concern over reports of politically motivated trials, unfair procedures and failures to investigate serious crimes such as killings, harassment and other acts of violence; urges the Russian judicial and law enforcement authorities to carry out their duties in an effective, impartial and independent manner in order to bring perpetrators to justice.
convict	convict_vrb	It says that, in a rape trial, it takes four male witnesses to convict a man but the testimony of a female is not accepted, not even that of the raped woman.
convict	convict_vrb	That is why I was reminded a little of the film Minority Report, in which the local police used clairvoyants to convict people before they had committed the crime.
convict	convict_vrb	The government should strive to convict those who carry out abductions and murders, rather than silencing those, like Oleg Orlov, who bring these issues to light.
convict	convict_vrb	In democratic Europe we do not convict people on the basis of assumptions, without any evidence.
convict	convict_vrb	We do not convict terrorists, but we are at best passive with regard to human rights breaches in the war on terror.
convict	convict_vrb	The resolution makes no mention of the workings of the Prevention of Atrocities Act, which was designed to help convict those who have attacked Dalits, and in addition it makes no mention of the fact that the rate of literacy, although very low for Dalits, is extremely close to the national average.
convict	None	On the road to peace it is vital that Russia should convict war criminals and that the army should withdraw.
convict	None	I find it difficult to understand why those whom it has not been possible to convict cannot stay in the United States, but European countries should themselves, of course, be prepared to receive those who have not ...
convict	None	At a time when we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, in the USA the five-hundredth convict since 1977, when the death penalty came back into force, is being executed while 3 000 more are on death row.
convict	None	As the convict in question was able to return to paid employment in Belgium and took advantage of the situation, we must do everything we can to avoid this sort of thing happening again.
convict	convict_vrb	We must help with the means at our disposal to find the perpetrators and convict them.
convict	convict_vrb	Whereas efforts are being made to convict the opponents of Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, nothing is being done to solve the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and other journalists who have been killed.
convict	None	If so, it would, in that case, mean the principle of non-double criminality, in other words, the refusal to convict nationals if they are involved in legal proceedings in another Member State.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	If it is to promote freedom of expression and the most basic human rights, Parliament must categorically distance itself from islamophobia and must condemn any attempts to correlate Islam and its believers with terrorism.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	This is why we have to correlate the population protection and development policies with the demographic policies.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	To enable the European Union to develop its innovative capacity, which is vital to its competitiveness, we must develop and correlate innovation policy with the EU's industrial policy.
correlate	None	Since 1850, average temperatures correlate well with solar cycles but very poorly with atmospheric CO2.
correlate	None	Finally, it is recommended that this text should correlate and reinforce the formal prohibition of dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	The Commission has therefore proposed clearer definitions of the concepts of 'workers' information' and 'workers' consultation' and a clarification of how these activities correlate at various levels.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	However, I can already announce that the outcome of this profound and serious exercise is quite satisfactory, especially because we confirmed the needs for enlargement, which correlate exactly to the same amounts we and Parliament agreed in 2002.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	I encourage the Commission and Member States to draw up medium- and long-term forecasts for the skills required in order to correlate study programmes with economic development.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	She rightly points out that any limitation on maximum quantities must correlate with actual processing capacities.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	I think it is necessary to correlate the TEN-T (Trans-European Network of Transport) strategy, where the Danube comes under point 18, with the new territorial and economic development strategy, so that development takes place in a cohesive manner.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	I begin by calling attention to the need to correlate industrial development with the improvement of social protection systems.
correlate	None	Essentially it contains a proposal for measures which aim to correlate screening practices with the results obtained in the various Member States.
correlate	None	Subsequently, the aid figures will need to correlate with the absolute numbers.
correlate	None	We cannot but correlate this illegal action with the installation of American military bases in Romania and with the imminent integration of this country into the European Union.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	It is therefore vital to define the principles for cohesion for the entire European Union and correlate them with the strategic frames of reference created by individual countries.
correlate	correlate_nou-vrb	It is also called upon to correlate any such initiative with the work of the World Bank group and other multilateral development organisations.
defect	defect_nou	We must ask what the Commission intends to do in the area of legislation to eliminate this defect in the system.
defect	defect_nou	Experience is a bonus; it cannot be a defect.
defect	defect_nou	I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.
defect	defect_nou	on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am trying to put myself in the position of the parents of a three-year-old girl diagnosed with a heart defect, for whom a three-year-old donor heart - not easy to find - was not available in her own country.
defect	defect_nou	At present, goods with an original defect can be returned within two years; this should be three years.
defect	defect_nou	We go along with the idea that certain rectifications are needed, but not in the same way for everyone, because that is the defect that we faced when the Council rejected the original proposals made by Commissioner MacSharry.
defect	defect_nou	This is a system defect which weakens the credibility of the entire European Commission and the search for greater integration.
defect	defect_nou	The slight defect is that it contains a certain number of inaccuracies which have not been removed at the committee stage.
defect	defect_nou	We have to be clear in our own minds that Liberia started out with a congenital defect, as the descendants of black African returnees from America were in violent conflict with the indigenous inhabitants from the word go and the state has never been internally united.
defect	defect_nou	Another defect in this resolution is the fact that in paragraph 36 it congratulates itself on the subject of the agreement drawn up a month ago between Parliament and the Council, on the procedure for authorising GMOs.
defect	defect_nou	It was out of the question for us to vote in favour of the Sterckx report, in view of its criticism of the Malaga measures jointly agreed by France and Spain to the great benefit of European maritime safety, but with the inherent defect, in the eyes of the majority in this Parliament, of being the product of cooperation between Member States and not of a supranational procedure.
defect	defect_nou	It is not about human error on the part of those managers who are now being put out to grass with severance packages worth 100 to 200 million dollars; no, it is the result of a structural defect.
defect	defect_nou	Amendment No 3 aims to abolish the obligation of the injured party to provide proof of the defect or the causal relationship between defect and damage under certain circumstances, and the vague wording of the amendment makes it difficult to determine what they are.
defect	defect_nou	If the OBD discovers a defect in the exhaust system, the fault must be removed.
defect	defect_nou	Finally, and this is particularly serious in my view, they extend the period of limitation from 10 to 20 years for damage resulting from a hidden defect.
defect	defect_nou	It contains a serious defect because it offers no safeguards to clients: a foreign lawyer who sets himself up with his home-country professional qualification and wants to work in Luxembourg law may know nothing about this specific law.
defect	defect_nou	Things cannot simply be allowed to run their course because what we have here, as has been said, is an inbuilt structural defect in the international financial system.
defect	defect_nou	Since there is no European demos, no European nation, this defect cannot be solved by strengthening the role of the European Parliament.
defect	defect_nou	Nevertheless, this report reveals a major defect: it is blatantly federalist in persuasion.
defect	defect_nou	A whole series of issues directly concern consumers, from the defect-free condition of products purchased, to confidence in transactions to on-line shopping and advertising.
defect	defect_nou	Above all, however, subdividing the Commissioners into those with voting rights and those without is a real structural defect, particularly where the Commission remains a collective body.
defect	defect_nou	This may be a defect in the Spanish translation, but the relevant procedural point is that they are not alleged, but proved.
defect	defect_nou	Some vehicles cannot leave the test centre; some can be take away to be repaired; while in other cases pass certificates may be issued on the undertaking that the defect is corrected before the next test.
defect	defect_nou	It was a hidden defect and the people who have been injured have to prove this themselves.
degenerate	None	However, it also advocates the division of Member States into electoral regions. This means a majority can create such numerous and such narrow constituencies that the system of proportional representation will degenerate into a monstrous majority voting system.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	It is of the utmost importance that the channels of communication be kept open, and a constructive stance will be required from both sides to ensure that the accession process is not delayed or does not completely degenerate into mutual distrust.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	Finally, with regard to intervention, we have tabled amendments seeking to strengthen the withdrawal mechanism to serve as a safety net, thereby contributing to market stability and the long-term survival of the fisheries product sector, whilst at the same time ensuring that it does not degenerate into a mechanism that merely provides a regular outlet for goods for which there is no market demand.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	The global environment is far too important to allow this to degenerate into another North/South divide.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	One of the major risks is that this will degenerate into a routine, that no one will take us seriously any more and that the results which we present will not be taken seriously either.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	Anyone wanting Europe to degenerate into a free-trade area will achieve their objective through Turkey's accession.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	I do not want the European Union to degenerate into a free trade zone with limited social liability; a core Europe that draws new dividing lines across Europe is unacceptable, and so the constitutional process must go on.
degenerate	degenerate_adj-nou	The MKO is a degenerate organisation, which is tantamount to a religious sect and which severely oppresses its own members, including within the camp.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	The international community has the duty to make sure that things do not degenerate in this country, both for the safety of its inhabitants and for the stability of the entire region, where terrorism is a real threat.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	The text maintains a good balance between the protection of the freedom of expression and of privacy and the need to continue the fight against cybercrime, also highlighting the major problem of excessive monitoring of Internet activity, which can degenerate into a new form of censorship.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	Our respect for international treaties must not be allowed to degenerate into misuse of this field of the law for political purposes.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	It is a crisis which could degenerate dangerously, but which can still probably be controlled if European diplomacy is able to show the same judgement and determination that has been shown by the precise actions of France and Germany.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	For if that is not respected - that is, the final bottom line when it comes to the authority of the President and order in this House - then we will degenerate into mob rule.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	- (NL) Commissioner, the rescuing of the European car industry is threatening to degenerate into an anti-European chronicle.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	The idea that painters are less intelligent than other people has been dispelled for ever, and can in future only be used in history books as an example of how a debate can sometimes degenerate for economic reasons.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	We are also concerned that the present situation might degenerate into a regional conflict.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	a fundamental tax reform with a general reduction in overall tax revenue; - targeted measures; - a clear promotion of renewable sources of energy.The ecotaxes, conceived as a policy instrument, should under no circumstances degenerate into a means of tapping new sources of revenue.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	Finally, we cannot allow the EU to degenerate into a union of transfers.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	We do not, however, want to see European cooperation cease or degenerate into bickering, which would be a risk if 30 countries could constantly use their vetoes.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	Without the Constitution, the EU will progressively degenerate into a customs union.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	I called competition policy an instrument, and that is what it is, rather than an end in itself; if it were an end in itself, it would very rapidly degenerate into something purely ideological.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	Another lesson identified in the report is the need for quicker and more decisive action by the international community in extremely tense situations which may degenerate into violence.
degenerate	None	The rural areas must not degenerate into a museum of folklore.
degenerate	degenerate_adj-nou	However, Communism and Fascism not only actively fought against most of the values of Europe, but were ready to break all the principles of ethics in the name of sick and degenerate ideas - and these systems really did break those principles, bringing pain, suffering and death to millions of people.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	The ultimately political debate on the future of the Structural Funds cannot be allowed to degenerate into an accounting operation.
degenerate	None	Only those who believe that a day such as this is also in fact maritime policy are indeed mistaken; a Maritime Day such as this should not degenerate into mere symbolism.
degenerate	None	On the one hand, we are proclaiming better reconciliation of work and family in order to improve the birth rate, which has been falling for years, and on the other hand we are letting Sundays and public holidays degenerate increasingly into normal working days - whereby traditions and family life inevitably fall by the wayside.
degenerate	degenerate_vrb	That is the brief for Stockholm, that is the brief for the following summit, which is precisely why Stockholm must not degenerate into a one-sided liberalisation summit.
delegate	None	Enshrining in the Treaty the ability to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts to supplement legislative acts is a step forwards in that it places the two institutions on an equal footing.
delegate	None	Is it not time to apply the subsidiarity principle and delegate competence in some fields to the Member States, for example in terms of cofinancing under the common agricultural policy?
delegate	delegate_vrb	To this end, public agencies can, by mutual agreement, delegate the handling of cases to non-governmental organisations, and this is the traditional practice in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.
delegate	delegate_vrb	It seems to me to make all kinds of sense to delegate the responsibility for small-scale projects to the Commission's representative in South Africa.
delegate	delegate_vrb	Why is it the case that a problem which can be very localised - this is, in fact, one of the very problems we are discussing at the moment - why is this something which we need to decide on in Brussels or Strasbourg and cannot delegate to national level?
delegate	delegate_nou	To the surprise of the Council and the ACP countries, the Cuban delegate - at the time the Minister for Industry - disappeared from the meeting, and there was no way this matter could be formalised because Cuba was not present to give its consent.
delegate	delegate_nou	I mention that because, when it came to my turn to speak, it enabled me, as a British delegate from a third party, to speak in support, despite the fact that all three parties have many different policies on different issues.
delegate	delegate_nou	As a delegate last week in Geneva, I witnessed that the Commission is arguably one of the most ineffective Commissions known to those long attenders.
delegate	delegate_nou	The recommendation by the UN's main delegate for refugee affairs to give refugee status to the asylum seekers of southern and central Iraq under the 1951 Convention was a welcome solution. As is the offer of additional forms of protection in cases where refugee status is not given.
delegate	delegate_nou	When attempts have been made to choose the delegate by election, these attempts have been declared to be invalid.
delegate	delegate_nou	While we are on this subject, allow me to point out to our fellow Members the presence, in our galleries, of Mrs Leïla Shahid, Palestine’s new delegate-general to the European Union, whom I should like warmly to welcome.
delegate	delegate_nou	The Danish delegate, the only delegate to have been personally present at the meeting of October 1990 - six years ago, that is - stated that at no time did the Commission ask the United Kingdom not to publish the results of its research.
delegate	delegate_vrb	It also means that the Member States have competences under their own common law, and no one needs to assign them as long as the European Union only has such competences to the extent that the Member States delegate and assign them and may also withdraw them, as in the case of the new type of mechanism that would replace the existing Article 308 according to this report.
delegate	delegate_vrb	In this respect, the national governments are right, as far as the European Employment Pact is concerned, not to delegate responsibility for employment policy to the European Union.
delegate	delegate_vrb	Delegated acts are when Parliament and Council delegate powers, but from now on, compared to the previous situation, we can take them back any time.
delegate	delegate_vrb	Is it the case that here, too, we want to delegate the work and the resolution of this conflict to the African Union?
delegate	delegate_vrb	You surely do not entertain the notion that Parliament will agree to delegate regulatory powers and jurisdiction without the facility to call them back if things go wrong?
delegate	delegate_vrb	Those Member States with a strong tradition of private consumer bodies would be able to delegate a fair number of cross-border cases to them.
delegate	delegate_vrb	We will want to hold it back in the legislative procedures. We will not want to delegate.
delegate	delegate_vrb	In the Treaty of Accession, the ten new Member States were granted the right to delegate one member each to, among other bodies, the European Court of Auditors.
delegate	delegate_vrb	Thanks to Parliament's insistence we have also reached compromise on the ability of national authorities to delegate approval of prospectuses to stock exchanges and others such as the nominated advisors in the aim market.
delegate	delegate_vrb	In the realm of security, however, there remains much to be done, and it is the responsibility of President Arafat to delegate real powers to his Prime Minister in relation to security; so that he can act and actually does act by means of his Interior Minister.
delegate	delegate_vrb	All I can say to you now is that when we meet the members of our groups to discuss the issue of ethics, we must not forget that the public believes that these are political issues for which we, as politicians, are responsible: we cannot delegate this responsibility.
delegate	delegate_vrb	We must first of all assess the possibilities offered by the Treaty: by permanent structured cooperation and by Article 44, which makes it possible to delegate the task of carrying out a mission to particular Member States, but within an EU procedural framework, which is not the same thing as renationalisation.
delegate	delegate_vrb	That is the framework for this new instrument, which allows the legislator to delegate part of its powers to the Commission (Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), provided that it is an act of general application that is used to supplement or amend parts of a legislative act that are not considered essential.
delegate	delegate_vrb	We are the ones with the legislative power and we delegate these powers to the Commission.
delegate	delegate_nou	As a German delegate I must unfortunately add an appeal to the Bundestag and Federal Government for them at long last to repeal the abstention pertaining in the Federal Republic from the UN Children's Convention, and thereby to create the conditions necessary for the harsh treatment of families and children generally found in expulsion cases to lose its legal sanction.
delegate	delegate_nou	It would not be right to ask the head of our delegation to take on further responsibilities given the staff shortage but I should like to tell you that it is our intention to substantially increase the responsibilities of the European Union delegate to the South African Republic.
delegate	delegate_nou	Jollie Dixon, the acting Special Delegate for the Commission appointed for this purpose, has now taken up his position in Pristina and it is time to solve the huge number of practical problems.
delegate	None	As I have had the honour of explaining to you on behalf of a number of my colleagues, this Rule provides for the non-attached Members to appoint one of their own as a delegate to the Conference of Presidents.
delegate	delegate_vrb	I can only recommend you dare more, delegate more.
deliberate	None	A necessary counterpart to independent financial control is the clear assignment of responsibility, of liability for deliberate contraventions or neglect of duty by officials such as is, incidentally, found in the national laws of all the Fifteen.
deliberate	deliberate_vrb	Mr President, it is of the utmost importance that we should, from time to time, deliberate about the state of transatlantic relations.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	A large part of the budget, intended for structural expenditure, does of course contribute to these imbalances, but this is deliberate since this expenditure is explicitly designed to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of the least prosperous Member States.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are certain things I would like to reiterate in order to firmly repudiate the insinuations and deliberate disinformation spread in recent days by the Liberals and Social Democrats about the reasons for this debate.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	We now see the crisis coming to country after country because of a deliberate policy that Mr Schulz and others defended in this Parliament two years ago.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Mr President, the issue of alleged fraud and irregularities in the tourism industry is one of the most worrying that the Committee on Budgetary Control has had to examine, because it comes close to a deliberate desire on the part of the Commission to avoid its responsibilities and to conceal from Parliament - an institution which, after all, represents the people of the European Union - the reality and gravity of the malfunctioning of DG XXIII.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Let us all hope, therefore, that the new directive will bring the expected improvements, and that the deliberate holding back of funds will become a thing of the past in the European Union.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	This is deliberate exploitation and ill-treatment of animals and should be taken into account as well.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Obviously there should be no deliberate over-fishing but this would encourage fishermen to observe the no-discard rule.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	I should also like to add a personal concern: we should note, in particular with regard to broadcasting in Cyprus, that there is an evident degree of manipulation of prime time slots; that there has been a deliberate exclusion of foreigners, such as Commissioner Verheugen – who will be the of our Cypriot colleagues in the next few weeks; and that this represents an unwholesome spectacle unworthy of a state that otherwise seeks to, and should, fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for taking the floor so many times, but I was personally involved in the drafting of this constitution, and I find it greatly disturbing to hear misapprehensions, whether deliberate, or unintentional.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	It is completely scandalous that this appointment, which should have taken place, as in all of our Parliament's bodies, either by election or by consensus, by election failing consensus, has not yet taken place due to deliberate manoeuvring by officials who are opposed to it.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	We do not support the deliberate introduction of tariff barriers which will increase the costs of transport operators from peripheral Member States and, by extension, the prices of the products transported.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	It is part of a deliberate strategy by the Iranian regime to systematically silence human rights activists.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	The case of Sam Rainsy brings to light the injustices occurring in Cambodia, where Mr. Rainsy, as the leader of the opposition party and Parliament member, has been confronted with what can only be viewed as a deliberate effort to curtail any opposition to the established Authoritarian Government.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	In these circumstances, it is a matter for the government of Spain to judge whether such incidents indicate a deliberate breach of the ETA ceasefire and to act accordingly.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Once again, the Green study's supposedly scientific findings were therefore deliberate scare-mongering, deliberately sowing anxiety in the minds of the public and pulling the wool over their eyes.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	(DE) Mr President, I think that what the Chinese are doing here is a deliberate political provocation, or to put it another way, a political test.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	I was horrified by these deliberate and cruel acts of murder and I immediately expressed my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Does it plan to make any arrangements to compensate for the unfair and deliberate damage caused?
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Purvis if he is going to table a vote of no confidence in the Commission, given the false information and the deliberate lies Commissioner Byrne has just uttered before the Members of Parliament present here today.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Regarding the definitions of scope, it would have been better to include not only the deliberate and fraudulent sides of such activities but also the commercial motives behind them.
deliberate	deliberate_vrb	The report concludes that the UN Security Council should deliberate on the Burma/Myanmar issue.
deliberate	deliberate_vrb	Another keyword is coordination between the institutions which deliberate on the violation of rights and award damages.
deliberate	deliberate_adj	Madam President, the Commission's report is a kind of incomplete account, with many deliberate omissions, of the implementation of Community policy on economic and social cohesion, and of the action and effectiveness of the Structural Funds.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	In view of the above, it is a matter of fundamental importance that prevention be placed at the centre of all strategies, and that efforts be made to ensure that diagnoses are made as early as possible.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	Faulty diagnoses which might result from incorrect use must be prevented at all costs, so it is vital that all possible sources of error are eliminated.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	As we are aware, vaccines constitute an essential instrument when associated with better, cheaper and more reliable tests for detecting the infection, as well as more efficient diagnoses and treatments.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	I also hope that our work can come to mean that those diagnoses will not represent a death sentence; rather a diagnosis needs to become a trigger for early, sensitive, humane intervention, successful treatment and re-entry into the world of work and a full and fulfilling life.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	The Petten High Flux Reactor has produced 60% of the isotopes needed for cancer diagnoses and therapies in European hospitals and other medical centres.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	At a time when we are tackling the reform of the Treaties, and now that the Convention is up and running, I would, therefore, say the same thing about these economic guidelines as about the employment guidelines: they should serve to share diagnoses, to establish clear codes of conduct and mechanisms for sanctions or penalties where misguided behaviour occurs.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	In Italy, 50% of confirmed AIDS diagnoses come at the same time as diagnoses of the HIV virus, which means that many people do not know they have HIV until they are ill.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	To use the medical simile of the state of the Union, it is necessary not only to take the supposed patient's pulse, but to give him a genuine health check-up, a thorough examination with diagnoses and proposals for cures.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	We know that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and that the most common diagnoses are lung cancer, bowel cancer (which some people have mentioned) and breast cancer.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	But Mr Solbes and Mr Trichet, in their respective domains, continue to strut the stage regardless and, like Diafoirus the physician and his son in Molière’s , to fob us off with their wrong diagnoses: ‘The diagnoses are the thing, I tell you’, says Diafoirus Solbes. ‘The diagnoses, I tell you’, replies Diafoirus Trichet.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	He also points out that there is a great discrepancy between the safety percentages of the different Member States, but I believe that that discrepancy does not exist in the diagnoses or in the most useful instrument: the legislation, setting limits and dissuasive measures.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	Mr President, I shall dispense with diagnoses, already conducted in great detail, and move straight on to three points concerning the prognosis of what is to be done.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	Over six million diagnoses are made annually in Europe due to this work.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	The additional diagnoses provide real revelations.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	Research programmes are recommended which offer solutions and not just diagnoses and classifications, as has been the case until now.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	I would add that, for years now, we have been saying that we need coordinated timetables, harmonised economic forecasts and shared diagnoses in order to decide on the economic strategies of the Member States of the euro area.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	It should also - when the circumstances so demand it - be a time for a serious reconsideration of the approach taken and, on this score, the Fourçans report offers some lucid diagnoses.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	We are drawing up guidelines, moreover, for managing medical diagnoses in the event of agents being spread by bioterrorists; we are preparing training courses in collaboration with Europol, and we are supporting national emergency plans that aim to make available an adequate number of vaccines and emergency assistance.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	Mr President, if a good policy consists of producing complete and correct diagnoses and drawing up and implementing the corresponding solutions, there is no doubt that the Commissions' energy policy, promoted by Commissioner de Palacio, is an example of a good policy.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	I was recently in Mauritania and saw how, in a very small hospital in a desert area of that country, health workers were making contact with French doctors in order to have some consultation on diagnoses for patients.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	– The Lage report rightly emphasises that the management measures adopted by the European Union are too often based upon faulty and unreliable scientific diagnoses.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	This nightmare takes on many guises, each one more monstrous than the last, whether it involves prenatal diagnoses, for example, which serve to destroy embryos affected by Down' s syndrome to avoid the trouble of eradicating the disease itself; whether it involves the production of excessive numbers of embryos that pile up in freezers; or whether, finally, it involves the cloning of human beings.
diagnoses	diagnoses_vrb	However, we should point out that the report fails to address the causes of situations that it sometimes diagnoses.
diagnoses	diagnoses_nou	Our report contains all the most important and correct diagnoses as well as all the demands which have to be fulfilled if sufficient numbers of young people are to continue to see their future in farming.
diagnoses	None	The report manages to ask questions and make diagnoses, but does not prescribe any medicine, which only serves to encourage these self-regulating instruments.
diffuse	None	The common position provides for an exception for pollutants from diffuse sources.
diffuse		Perhaps this is because, in some instances, the legislation has been over-ambitious, as well as too vague and diffuse.
diffuse		Being an invisible enemy, which is geographically diffuse, and which can be found inside and outside of our borders, it needs to be fought in a way that is different to the way the European Union has had to fight its enemies in the past.
diffuse		And though Member States hold diffuse views about Russia, your presidency was quick to negotiate its six-point plan and for that credit is due.
diffuse		in writing. - (FR) As draftsman of the opinion on water quality, I saw that pesticides were implicated in the degradation of the environment, and particularly of surface and coastal waters, because they persist over time, can be transported over long distances, and constitute a diffuse form of pollution, which is difficult to locate resulting from runoffs, direct losses in the soil and the air, the washing of plants by the rain and so on.
diffuse		The European Union suffers from the fact that it presents a diffuse image to the public.
diffuse		The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats succeeded in voting down Recital G (by 321 votes with 169 in favour and 21 abstentions) and, thus, the attempt to create a new and diffuse definition of what constitutes a family, something that is definitely not a task for the EU.
diffuse		One senses a diffuse anxiety seeping through his report which contrasts happily with the steadfast optimism of the various advocates of the euro, together with reaffirmation - somewhat timid but reaffirmation nonetheless - of a few basic principles, all of which are superfluous.
diffuse		It would therefore be welcome if the resolution were to suggest the creation of structures at this level - genuine response measures for extremely serious situations - where necessary and did not lay down vague and diffuse responsibilities for families and communities in this area.
diffuse		I do not care whether we talk about Al Qaeda, about Islamist terrorism, about radical or fundamentalist groups, or about groups which claim to defend Islam, but terrorism’s main advantage is its diffuse nature.
diffuse		If we put a corresponding amount of money into the rational use of energy, the investment is seen as being significantly more diffuse.
diffuse		Diffuse water pollution is an immense environmental problem, and plant protection products are part of that problem.
diffuse		Noise pollution reaches us in diffuse, sporadic and intangible ways; often it even forms part of our daily environment.
diffuse		On the web, the best rubs shoulders with the worst: on the one hand, there are tremendous opportunities to diffuse and receive valuable, targeted information, for better social cohesion; on the other, it is an ideal forum for stereotypes, prejudices, derogatory views and even dangerous content, as was mentioned in the question.
diffuse		Discussion of the ecological and social consequences of mass tourism, such as water pollution, the alienation of the local population, or exploitation on the part of multinational hotel chains is absent or too diffuse.
diffuse		This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague' (p.18).
diffuse		We are increasingly faced with diffuse and unconventional threats and, with this in mind, Europe must have an adequate strategy for prevention, detection and protection, so that the safety and health of Europeans can be guaranteed.
diffuse		The chemical cocktail in our waters has become more complex and the sources of pollution are no longer concentrated at one point but are widespread and diffuse.
diffuse		European Union actions are still very diffuse and complex in this area.
diffuse		For most sectors, the requirements consist of emission limits and limits on diffuse emissions.
diffuse		We must also determine whether there is a need to enact rules on the indirect introduction of pollutants from point sources and diffuse sources.
diffuse		I therefore welcomed the adoption of the Council's common position - and the approximation of positions that avoided the need for us to continue with a conciliation procedure - and, as such, the forthcoming entry into force of a regulation that is clear, technically secure and able to put the EU in a different position to the one that culminated, as a result of the diffuse nature of regulations, in the anti-GMO moratorium that led the USA to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation.
diffuse		To strengthen this credibility and to diffuse any doubts about double standards, the EU should make it absolutely clear that relations with our Eastern neighbours must be grounded, first and foremost, on democratic values, respect for human rights and the rule of law.
diffuse		Agriculture and forestry, however, are still problems, with their diffuse discharges.
diffuse		In the context of the EMPA committee responsible for cultural affairs, we have proposed the creation of a cultural contact committee made up of respected experts who are capable of dialogue, in order to respond to cultural and religious conflicts, to mediate, clarify and diffuse cultural and religious tension between the two flanks of the Mediterranean.
diffuse		Certainly, reaching an agreement between Israel and Syria could help to diffuse tensions in Lebanon, and therefore we have thrown our full support behind the current political process.
discard		So I will discard some of my remarks that would otherwise have been rather repetitive, which should allow even more honourable Members to take part in this exceptionally important and, I think in terms of procedure, almost unique debate.
discard		We must not only end the discard of cod and other fish, but we have to end the scandal of the discard of cod and other fish.
discard		We have the opportunity to discard ludicrous taxes on fuel particles as well as technical pseudo-solutions, expenditure on which far exceeds their benefit.
discard		So the Council seems to have chosen to discard this issue which is not at all technical, but which calls into question some very important principles, and leave it up to the officials at the EMI.
discard		We do not want to discard the article but reshape it.
discard		When judging figure skating, we discard the highest and lowest marks and then award the score.
discard		However, is it not sinister that recipients should be told which economic policies they should choose and which they should discard?
discard		Nor can we discard, whenever possible, a genuine multilateral approach with a view to improving standardisation, and the need to improve mechanisms within the WTO framework; all this will prove extremely useful.
discard		This debate should also help multinationals to realise that they cannot simply use and discard; they cannot receive incentives such as Community funding or tax breaks in one Member State and then head off to another in an attempt to obtain further support and more benefits.
discard		When you discard it, you discard your civilised rights.
discard		The Spanish Government may accept our view but it may also discard it.
discard		In response to the question by Mr Davies as to when the Commission will introduce measures to end the discard of by-catch by fishing vessels, I should like to point out first of all that the Commission considers discarding to be a serious problem in European fisheries, and is committed to acting on this issue as a priority.
discard		Here I note with interest your proposal to test new uses of monitoring of discard practices as was done in some third countries.
discard		The practice is amoral, unethical and completely unsustainable and results directly from the Common Fisheries Policy, which criminalises fishermen for landing by-catch, thereby forcing them to discard - fishermen who are desperately trying to make a living while faced with ever-depleting levels of fish stocks.
discard		There have been problems because of the all-too-familiar discard issue, discards that we cannot allow for the sake of our fishermen or for the sake of our planet.
discard		The EU has been strengthened by the existing community policies, and moreover, it goes against the founding treaties to discard cohesion and agricultural policies that serve well the interests of EU citizens.
discard		As responsible politicians, we must discard the dogmas of the past and recognise that all clean technologies have their role to play.
discard		President Barroso's non-imperial empire is not as benign as he would have us believe, so, if you want to move forward, discard Giscard and dump the Lisbon Treaty as well as the CFP.
discard		According to some experts, such as Thorvaldur Gylfason, Professor of Economics at the University of Iceland, a fee-based trading policy, determined by an independent authority, could make every kilo of sustainable fish valuable so that there would be no inducement to discard fish or land it illegally.
discharge		Demands are being made of European policymakers and of this House, and we have to face up to our responsibilities and discharge them.
discharge		As a result of this situation, the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, acting on the instructions of the committee, made a request in this House on 15 January 1999 for the Rules Committee to clarify precisely what the Treaty itself provides for, that is to say for the direct link between refusal of discharge and a possible censure procedure to be removed.
discharge		2007 discharge: European Aviation Safety Agency (
discharge		His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge.
discharge		2009 discharge: EU general budget - Committee of the Regions (
discharge		It is now 2010 and we are discussing the discharge for 2008, as it was impossible to implement anything during 2009.
discharge		I declined to vote in favour of granting discharge for the execution of the Commission’s budget for 2002 owing to the persistent lack of clarity on matters such as Eurostat.
discharge		Concerns with the administration model of the European Police College meant that Parliament refused to discharge its 2008 accounts.
discharge		This is why we decided to postpone the discharge until the autumn, so that the checks required for the sake of budgetary transparency can be carried out.
discharge		This was already mentioned in last year's report by the Court of Auditors and was an important component in Mr Mulder's discharge last year.
discharge		At the beginning of the year, the Council Presidency advised us to issue the discharge for the 1996 and 1997 budgets, thereby giving us advice that was actually long out of date.
discharge		the report by Edit Herczog, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2005 [C6-0387/2006 -,
discharge		I voted in favour of postponing the decision to grant discharge for the financial year 2009: the Court of Auditors again qualified its opinion with regard to the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts for the financial year 2009.
discharge		If no discharge is given at the end of the year, this sends a clear political signal to the Commission, and a debate in this Parliament on the Commission's political and other functions strikes me as absolutely inevitable.
discharge		This splendid work has led the majority to recommend giving discharge.
discharge		Mr President, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009.
discharge		My second point is that I am the shadow rapporteur on the Mulder report on discharge for the Commission.
discharge		- A5-0212/2004 by Mr Mulder, on the discharge to the European Agency for Reconstruction for the financial year 2002 (C5-0632/2003 – 2003/2242(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2002 (C5-0636/2003 – 2003/2246(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2002 (C5-0635/2003 – 2003/2245(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the financial year 2002 (C5-0638/2003 – 2003/2255(DEC)); on the discharge to the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (C5-0637/2003 – 2003/2247(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2002 (C5-0630/2003 – 2003/2240(DEC)); on the discharge to Eurojust for the financial year 2002 (C5-0662/2003 – 2003/2256(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2002 (C5-0641/2003 – 2003/2259(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2002 (C5-0631/2003 – 2003/2241(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2002 (C5-0634/2003 – 2003/2244(DEC)); on the discharge to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia for the financial year 2002 (C5-0633/2003 – 2003/2243(DEC));
discharge		The Court of Auditors has submitted a statement of assurance in which it recommends the granting of discharge.
discharge		I suppose that on this issue of the discharge of the Council, the points of controversy between us and the Council are of such a sensitive nature that it makes sense to hold further talks.
discharge		It must be said that there are colleagues in this House in all groups - mine included - who believe that such is the severity of the problems which was displayed by the European Commission over the 1996 discharge, that they could not grant discharge and they will vote for the motion of censure.
discharge		- A6-0093/2006 by Umberto Guidoni, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2004 [2005/2107(DEC)];
discharge		I should therefore like to point out that, when we give discharge of the European Parliament's budget, this issue must be fully clarified because, otherwise, we will not be able to vote positively.
discharge		Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for this report, which concludes the budget discharge for 1999.
discharge		Of course we do not give discharge to the Member States, we give it to the Commission.
discharge		The Committee on Budgetary Control has submitted five other reports on discharge.
discharge		in writing. - I voted to give discharge to Eurojust and congratulate the agency for establishing measures to estimate the market value of relevant products/services before commencing a procurement procedure.
discharge		That is why Parliament must assume its responsibilities as a discharge authority and refuse to grant CEPOL discharge for the financial year 2008 in the circumstances of which we are aware.
discharge		I will vote not to grant discharge but that does not mean that I refuse it definitively.
discharge		We were unable in the Budgetary Control Committee to recommend discharge for 1994, which should have taken place last April, because the Court gave us wind of some rather unusual circumstances whereby the management board and the director had to inveigle staff to transfer from Berlin to Thessaloniki.
discharge		two motions of censure on the Commission pursuant to Rule 34, tabled by Mrs Green and others and Mr Fabre-Aubrespy and others; -the following oral questions to the Commission on the discharge for 1996: -B4-0012/99 by Mrs Green, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on improving European Union financial management; -B4-0011/99 by Mr Martens and Mr Elles, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on 1996 discharge; -B4-0009/99 by Mr Cox, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the reaction to Parliament's refusal to grant discharge concerning the 1996 budget of the European Union; -B4-0013/99 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, on the consequences for the Commission of the refusal to give discharge for the 1996 budget; -B4-0014/99 by Mr Puerta, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the consequences for the Commission of the refusal to give discharge for the 1996 budget; -B4-0016/99 by Mrs Aelvoet, Mr Holm and Mrs Müller, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on discharge for 1996; -B4-0015/99 by Mrs Lalumière, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on referral by Parliament back to the Committee on Budgetary Control of the report on discharge for the 1996 budget of the European Union.I shall give the floor initially to the two first signatories of the motions of censure, and then to the groups which have tabled questions concerning the refusal to give discharge.
discharge		Do not forget that we are talking about a discharge for the year 1995 and here we have a report in February 1997 saying things like: ' There are inherent defects in the common market organization in olive oil which have become increasingly apparent over time and which mean that efficient control is not always possible... The inherent defect in the system remained, namely the common interest of producer and mill owner to declare high figures.
discharge		In this context, I would like to propose that in committee, we deliberate formally inviting the institutions we are discussing to the next discharge debate and postponing the debates accordingly if they are not present.
discharge		in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Network and Information Security Agency and, in doing so, I note with disappointment that there has been no progress since the previous year concerning the refund of EUR 45 000 which is the amount of VAT paid in advance by the Agency to the tax authorities of the host Member State; urges, therefore, the Agency to inform the discharge authority when this refund is made by the host Member State.
discharge		Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report winds up the 1998 discharge procedure.
discount		But this discount does not mean turning a blind eye when it comes to the candidate countries.
discount		We need the sort of consumption that prepares for the future, that is in line with the challenges of sustainable development, responsible consumption that is not always seeking to promote discount products that are supposed to enhance the purchasing power of families but which, in fact, are often mediocre in quality and which derive from the almost systematic relocation of their production outside the Union.
discount		Germany has a tradition or number of discount supermarkets.
discount		That said, I would ask you to consider that if we discount those amendments that go beyond the scope of Article 152, we can accept, fully or partially, a majority of them.
discount		We cannot discount the possibility that there is a breach of international law in relation to criminal proceedings.
discount		We should not discount the possibility that Lukashenko is blackmailing the Kremlin, which has hitherto been vital to his stranglehold on political power.
discount		If the Socialist Group wish to discount what we feel, wish to discount what we say and wish to discount what we really believe in our inner hearts, then you can do so. But you do so at a price and at a very serious price.
discount		Of course, this is not intended either to discount the Commission evaluation within the framework of this year's, and more importantly, next year's progress report, nor does it have to do with any other criteria over and above the Copenhagen criteria.
discount		There can be no input on the part of the European Union, nor can any kind of discount be given.
discount		In addition, the supermarket sells milk at a discount, but it is the farmer who loses money.
discount		I think that excesses in competition law such as we saw at the start of the year in Germany, when a firm wanting to offer a 20% discount was prohibited from doing so by a court order, will be a thing of the past.
discount		This year, the United Kingdom alone will receive a rebate of some EUR 3 billion because of a discount on contributions negotiated in 1984.
discount		Airports will levy the same charge for the same service, although discounts may be granted to airport users based on the quality of a service used, provided that all airport users can benefit from this discount under public, transparent and objective conditions.
discount		Granting small businesses a discount enables us to accommodate this category of business, which is very important within the food sector, to some degree.
discount		Cost orienteering entails that if you have fewer costs, you cannot make a claim on the same discount.
discount		In my view, it is absurd for decisions on changes to train schedules, the drawing-up of discount schemes, reservation charges and so on to be taken at EU level.
discount		I am speaking here about products like discount holiday clubs, where consumers often have to pay a substantial amount up front, ranging from EUR 6 000 to EUR 20 000, for membership of a club, which will only give a right to a discount on future holidays.
discount		The European Union did not discount the possibility of using military force at the summit Council but, as Mr Anderson and Mr Cushnahan and many other members pointed out, this should be the last resort.
discount		In addition, to begin with, a discount of up to seven grams is to be allowed for 'eco-innovations' such as solar roofs and economical air-conditioning systems.
discount		These measures would provide support for vessels running on petrol, similar to what is happening with diesel, establish a maximum price level or an additional discount for fuel, specifically of 40 cents per litre, improve prices at the initial point of sale without any repercussions on prices for the end consumer, ensure that production costs are one of the variables taken into account when setting guidance prices and ensure a fair income for crews.
discount		In German law, for example, we have the Discount Act and the Bonus Regulations, and it is certainly fair to say that nothing of the kind exists anywhere else.
document		Article 161 of the 1985 accession document establishes Spain' s share of hake from the northern stock in Divisions Vb, VI, VII and VIIIab, that is to say the western waters including the Bay of Biscay, at 30 per cent.
document		The Commission has decided to confirm its participation as an observer, as it shares the view of the majority of the Member States that the European Union's red lines have been retained in the conference document.
document		Mr President, how could I not vote for this document protecting animals, which, although certainly destined for a cruel fate, should at least be treated as beings that deserve our respect and our protection in matters of transportation, as Mr Ebner has just said.
document		Frankly, I am not really convinced that our Parliamentary work benefits from the House being tied for over a year and a half to working on a document, even a document as authoritative as the White Paper - with over 400 amendments and who knows what other complications - not least in that the result is this, of necessity very brief, concise debate, in which it is difficult to address a subject of this kind.
document		In the interest of subsidiarity, paragraphs and related amendments dealing with reproductive health should not be included in an EP document, unless clearly and honestly defined.
document		in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because the Agreement includes a gradual phasing-in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far reaching cooperation on a number of issues including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, environment, air traffic management, state aids and competition.
document		So what is the problem with the document we are dealing with?
document		The way the framework agreement, and in particular Annex 3, is worded, it gives the Commission the final decision in any dispute as to whether a document shall be handed over to Parliament or not.
document		I have to let you know that I have now received a document from the High Representative, and from the Commission, and that the key criticisms have been addressed in this document.
document		The structure of the document favours a better definition and ordering of the objectives and scope of the directive.
document		(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, it was a year ago, Commissioner, that you presented us with this document, and I think that a lot has happened in that time.
document		I hope that the Council does not do to the Finnish Presidency what it did to the Austrian Presidency. Hopefully, it will honour its commitments and adopt the document in the form in which we are set to adopt it, because this is the only way in which we will have an agreement at first reading and in which the second generation Schengen Information System will enter into force without delay.
document		in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this document, because in the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact, the adjustment and adherence to the medium-term budgetary objective should be ensured through an obligation to lodge an interest-bearing deposit temporarily imposed on a Member State whose currency is the euro that is making insufficient progress with budgetary consolidation.
document		This is a formidable document that should commend itself to the people of Europe.
document		The Liberal Group believes that, in addition to all kinds of practical measures which are included in the document, it is, in particular, high time that criminal prosecution was improved by means of European cooperation.
document		Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in this document, local development and employment initiatives have finally achieved Europe-wide recognition of their importance as an essential instrument in combatting unemployment.
document		What we do not need, though, is a document entitled ‘Constitution’ which frightens people off rather than involving them.
document		Yesterday mention was made of a document which was quoted partially in the press about the ongoing affair of the chief accountant who has been suspended.
document		I voted in favour of this document because a general consensus and high priority has been given to European integration by the government and opposition parties in Montenegro, which has resulted in good progress in the reform process since the independence of the country.
document		While ultimately I welcome the working document the Commission has just published on developments in and prospects for Community action in sport, I very much regret that it has played down the doping problem.
document		Whilst I fully support many measures which have been suggested to stop tax fraud and evasion, this document went far further, and there were three major concerns.
document		We are thinking of a new document - we discussed it with some parliamentary officials this morning - that could be made available to Members of Parliament and European election candidates to show specifically what this new Constitution consists of and how it can be useful for specific policies to benefit the citizens.
document		In view of the double standards employed, I appeal for another, third referendum to be held in Ireland, and for the possibility of a renewed vote on this document in the national parliaments of EU Member States.
document		Accordingly, the document that has just been adopted is limited in scope, although it does contain some welcome proposals aimed at striking a degree of balance as regards combating pollution, albeit in watered-down form.
document		Central to the resolution will be the acceptance or rejection of the document.
document		The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.
document		The Commission document on the European growth initiative only refers, however, to redeploying existing appropriations and does not mention a single extra euro.
document		This is being taken seriously because it has the weight of an institutional statement demanding the right to participate in processes of this kind and have its work taken into account; if only because this 'construction of Europe' would be a poor thing if a matter as important as the competitiveness of the textile and clothing industry went no further than the document the Commission has submitted.
document		The Commission's document contains no assessment either of how a policy of competitiveness can promote the availability, quality and cost-effectiveness of public services.
document		It is now apparently the intention, since the Constitution has been shot down in public debates in the Netherlands and France, to force this document through in backrooms.
document		This resolution is yet another European Parliament document, concerning human rights abuses in Russia, which is linked to the EU through a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement - currently in force - and through a strategic partnership that it now appears is based not on shared values but on pragmatism, seeking economic and other benefits.
document		Our group virtually rewrote the directive, and the document we have before us today is the result of those efforts, in the course of which we showed all the willingness to compromise that was required.
document		The document analyses the conditions necessary so that the policy mix may continue to be as balanced as possible, thereby allowing us to achieve longer-lasting growth.
document		I voted for this document, as I believe it will positively affect most European Union Member States, especially the newest EU members.
document		To say that is no more than to state a fact, but I do not, of course, deny that such a statement of such a fact acquires political significance when contained in a strategy document of this sort, and I can also tell you that this political message, this political significance is deliberate.
document		Unfortunately, after both the referendum decision in Ireland and the Polish President's decision, voices were heard in the European Union, including those of some prominent politicians, demanding the ratification of this document by Poland, which is a denial of the essence of European democracy.
document		This document was signed by India, a country that owes so much to Mahatma Ghandi, who was a fervent advocate of the rights of the individual.
document		Furthermore, the Commission's document begins with the observation that 80 % of Europe's citizens live in cities: cities are where the greatest economic and social changes have occurred these past few years, cities have to face the processes of economic globalization that often upset their economies.
document		The document stresses the importance of the principle of the freedom of the legislator to delegate its powers to the Commission as a tool for better law-making.
document		We need evidence that the use of PNR data leads to greater security and that they are not used only to catch people who commit document fraud, drug smuggling or whatever. We need evidence and not just anecdotes.
document		The amendment stating that the Member States may issue a document to supplement the residence permit, which may be updated or withdrawn when the person's labour market situation changes, was voted through.
document		The document is not perfect.
dove		To get incoming President Medvedev tied by the fait accompli if fighting occurs today between the Russian and Georgian military, which can easily be orchestrated by Russia's secret services - or, by contrast, to give him the chance to play a dove; to affect the forthcoming elections in Georgia; to take revenge on the EU over Kosovo by punishing Georgia; to stop Georgia's progress in economic growth and fighting corruption after a major shift from a Russian to a Western type of state management.
dove		Unlike in the Bible story, this time the dove will not bring an olive branch as a sign of peace, but as a sign of danger.
dove		Today I ask for us to send that dove to the farthest corner of the world, so that it may return carrying the will to change of all the nations of the world.
dove		When we are seeing that thousands are dying and people are fleeing in their millions, we must not comfort ourselves with phrases recalling the dove of peace, but must take action.
dove		Mr Commissioner, I know very well that even with an olive branch in your mouth, you could never be a dove!
dove		Dove Weisglass is not lying when he clearly asserts that withdrawing from Gaza simply means mothballing the peace process.
duplicate		We are in favour of an effective, independent FRA, with well-defined work objectives that do not duplicate the work of existing bodies.
duplicate		The proposed amendments would simply duplicate or encroach on these documents.
duplicate		If we want to bring Europe closer to the people by making it their Europe, rather than a Europe run by a political elite, we have to ensure a strict separation of powers and the elimination of duplicate mandates.
duplicate		On the other hand, I have reservations concerning the creation of a European consumer centre which would duplicate the role of the national organisations, which are effective and would benefit from working as a network.
duplicate		In order to ensure that the EU of 25 Member States functions properly, more transparency and cohesion are needed in order to avoid the establishment of ever more diverse agencies, many of which would duplicate the responsibilities and activities of the relevant Commission services.
duplicate		I said we do not want to duplicate our activity, because that would achieve nothing, but wish to make a real contribution to resolving the question.
duplicate		That has resulted in duplicate claims for the same land by both tenant and farmer.
duplicate		It seems to me that the formation of another working group would involve an additional administrative burden and would in a sense duplicate the functions of the existing management system: it would in fact conflict with the aim of simplifying the CAP.
duplicate		In simple terms, that means that one state should not duplicate and prejudice existing neighbouring facilities.
duplicate		The forum should not replace or duplicate existing initiatives which will drive forward the debate of the EU level, and should be a forum which will not be all mouth but which will have real teeth.
duplicate		We must continue these contacts, so as not to duplicate what we do - simply in order to save money.
duplicate		It should, however, be recognised at the same time that the EU should support, not duplicate, the work done by the Member States.
duplicate		The proposed EIT will duplicate and conflict with existing EU programmes, like the Framework Programme for Research, the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and the Lifelong Learning Programme.
duplicate		We do not want to duplicate work: we want to be practical.
duplicate		We must not forget, however, that there is a great deal of expertise in the sector itself at the moment, and we must not duplicate the effort.
duplicate		The Commission has the help of Eurostat and in the near future will be able to rely on the Schengen information system or the European information system. In my opinion, these elements would be perfectly adequate and we should not duplicate remits, duties or structures.
duplicate		However, one body based in one place, instead of three located in three different cities with the accompanying costly duplicate structures, would have been sufficient.
duplicate		For this reason I have indicated on my group's voting list a negative vote on certain paragraphs that duplicate points mentioned elsewhere in the report.
duplicate		We simply cannot afford to duplicate efforts or waste time when the UN action plan has to a certain extent already evolved.
duplicate		It is with that thought in mind that I suggest that we would be better advised not simply to duplicate the work of the committees.
duplicate		It does not seek to be fully comprehensive and it does not try to duplicate information which is already available from, for example, EU websites, or to provide an account of action taken by individual Member States.
duplicate		Those amendments apply also to the excellent reports by Professors Cabrol and Trakatellis respectively and I do not intend to duplicate the comments on the budgets hereafter.
duplicate		Clearly, for now, non-animal alternatives do not exist for all the tests we need, so the role of ‘one substance, one registration’ to avoid duplicate testing is key.
duplicate		Amendments Nos 3, 7, 10, 16, 24 and 31 are not acceptable because they duplicate provisions present in other articles and the technical Amendments Nos 15, 26 and 30 would operate to increase the burden of control measures, seeking to introduce more stringent measures than those of Directive 90/679/EEC, which regulates the protection of workers from risks from exposure to biological agents at work.
duplicate		The intention is to promote compliance as a consistent standard, rather than to duplicate the ECHR.
duplicate		It seems curious to me to propose another agency, more machinery, and more budgetary expenditure to duplicate work that is already taking place.
duplicate		There is therefore no question of our wanting to duplicate things that are already happening under the aegis of the Social Fund.
duplicate		While I am sure we all wish to find ways of combating the threat of terrorism, I am not at all clear why the EU feels it necessary, with its framework decision, to duplicate action that has already been taken in the Council of Europe.
duplicate		Galileo is a hugely ambitious and expensive attempt by the EU to rival the US as a fully-fledged global and space power, why else duplicate GPS?
duplicate		If we do, we will have parts of the market that duplicate each other within the same area, and rail will constitute a substitute for road transport.
escort		Today, among other things, they will be able to demand compensation for delays or damage to luggage, while persons of reduced mobility will receive a special escort.
escort		Finally, I must also say that I am deeply shocked to see the police officers who have to escort refused asylum-seekers become the victims of slander. They are being labelled as murderers, even in this House.
escort		Could the huissiers please escort out of the Chamber those who are leaving the debate.
escort		My personal reflection leads me to the conviction that it would be a mistake to meekly allow the project of a Constitutional Treaty to perish and, in effect, to escort it to the cemetery.
escort		When we left the Élysée Palace last week, after our meeting there, you provided us with a police escort with flashing lights, and I was in a car with Mr Cohn-Bendit behind the police.
escort		It is an 'escort' of the anti-grass roots, reactionary action plan being discussed at the informal summit in England to extend capitalist restructurings within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, make drastic cuts to social benefits, agricultural production and small and medium-sized enterprises and transfer resources to strengthen the military capitalist mechanisms.
escort		It is against this backdrop that the European Parliament has been presented with a draft Council directive aiming to harmonise and regulate assistance, within the framework of repatriation with or without an escort, in transit airports within the European Union.
escort		In my view, it would be right and proper to extend the escort requirement for particularly dangerous goods here, such as corrosive substances or explosives.
escort		The Baltic Sea should also have special zones which these ships could traverse only with the protection of an escort, for example a pilot ship, with oil slick control facilities.
escort		My fellow members have cited several examples: KLA weapons, extremists being transported by air-conditioned bus under NATO escort so that they can continue to wage war in other areas, the declaration made by Mr Leotard - was that a faux pas or a calculated declaration?
escort		However, to be able to enjoy the benefit of this escort, the responsible national bodies and the sea vessels must notify Operation Atalanta and request protection.
escort		The refugees can only leave the camps in order to receive emergency medical treatment, with a military escort accompanying them in most cases.
escort		Sadly, however, we have to recognize that a common European policy has failed in regard to Albania, and in those circumstances we have also to say that the dispatch of humanitarian assistance is now necessary and that it needs the right kind of escort, in accordance with the mandate set out in the UN Security Council's decision of 28 March.
escort		Passengers under the influence of alcohol are one aspect of this, but the original effect of this proposal would have been to limit it to asylum seekers being sent home or to prisoners under escort.
escort		Mayors of towns like Hebron were not able to escort us to places that our ambassador had arranged for us to see.
escort		I could also introduce you to those commercial service providers, including the coffee shop 'De Tevreden Roker' [The Satisfied Smoker] and the 'Picobello Escort Service' club, which would certainly be keen to become active in Luxembourg, or elsewhere for that matter.
escort		Furthermore, what measures are being taken to immediately escort these illegal immigrants back to the European Union' s external border?
estimate		The draft directive requires electricity and gas distribution undertakings to establish planning techniques which will take account of all of the possible energy source options and estimate their demand-response potential in the context of demand-side management.
estimate		Moving expenses should be paid on the basis of an estimate and not in the form of two months' additional salary of around SEK 360 000.
estimate		As for the letter of amendment, to which some of our discussions in the coming weeks will relate, I should like to note that the Council expects a balance estimate for the 2001 budget year to be included.
estimate		In the absence of precise information on movements and other parameters, the estimate has to be based on the general structure of the various production systems.
estimate		And then we reconvene together with the Council and the Commission to finally discuss the key issues, i.e. a satisfactory estimate for Kosovo, an overall estimate for the Balkans and then a review of the financial perspectives, a satisfactory estimate for the Balkans.
estimate		Notwithstanding information from various sources, including the National Intelligence Estimate report, we cannot today be certain that Iran will not develop such weapons.
estimate		I would therefore suggest that at the end of European summits, the political conclusions should be published, alongside a rough estimate of the financial implications.
estimate		In the current world situation, where the price of oil and other energy sources - gas, for example - is rising steeply but is subject to unpredictable swings that make it difficult to plan sensibly and estimate investment costs and when the energy demands of European countries are also rising, a report on the subject of biogas would appear to be an unusually timely document.
estimate		There are many reasons why it is difficult to estimate expenditure accurately.
estimate		With this in mind, I think that the possibility of assistance being granted in the form of an advance payment scheme, based on an initial estimate of the direct losses, to a country affected by a disaster, at its request, would be a facility greatly appreciated by the affected areas, immediately after a disaster has occurred.
estimate		One estimate by the Finnish National Public Health Institute puts the health costs incurred at tens of millions of euros, and, indirectly and in the worst case scenario, this will also lead to the death of some Finnish citizens.
estimate		That is nearly four times the Commission's own estimate of the trade benefits from the single market.
estimate		Even if you take the highest estimate, if you aggregate that estimate down to the cost per bird, you are talking about one British penny per bird.
estimate		Let me perhaps give you a few very rough figures once again: we estimate the need at EUR 5.5 billion and, overall, 3.3 billion of that will come from the external action heading.
estimate		The auditors have refused to clear 92% of the European Union's expenditure for 2009, and they estimate that at least GBP 6 billion should not have been paid out - a similar amount to that of last year, which has not yet been recovered.
estimate		Who would still dare to speak of disaster-mongering or ill omens of charlatan ecologists on the environmental state of our planet, in the face of WHO studies which estimate the number of deaths caused by automobile exhaust emissions at 800 000 each year.
estimate		Scientists estimate, with a high degree of probability, that strong earthquakes may well occur in the medium and long term.
estimate		Because of variations in harvests and in world market prices, it is not easy to estimate the need for export support from the budget, for example.
estimate		Although the Commission has received rather positive feedback, some civil society representatives could estimate that their views have not been fully taken into account in the final documents adopted by the summit.
estimate		The Commission will seek to advance the development of the guidelines referred to in Annex VIIb of the Directive by 2011 and will cooperate with Member States to develop the data and the methodologies needed to estimate and monitor the contribution of heat pumps to the fulfilment of the objectives of the Directive.
estimate		The cost of resolving the financial crisis is impossible to estimate now, but one calculation that has been put forward suggests a figure in the region of USD 50 000 billion.
estimate		Now the situation is still more difficult, as we have 10 new Member States for which it is a problem even to estimate the extent of future structural and cohesion policy.
estimate		Due to the complexity of the legal issues involved with this draft convention, it is not possible at this stage to estimate with any certainty when work on the convention will be completed.
estimate		On the other hand, the model in the West has given rise to diseases such as obesity, various types of cancer and diabetes: diseases which we estimate will be responsible for 72% of deaths by 2020.
estimate		Along with many scientists, we estimate that the spreading of carcinogenic dioxins into the human food chain will undoubtably be the scourge of the next century.
estimate		In specific terms, we estimate that, at the moment, this accounts for 1% of our inflation and a reduction of around 0.3% of our growth. Some specific professional sectors - farming, fishing and transport - are in situations which are at times frankly difficult.
estimate		I voted in favour of the report by my Polish colleague Mr Lewandowski on Parliament's estimate of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2009.
estimate		As you know, we commissioned a study and have already received the results; we have scientific confirmation of the need for this Institute and an initial estimate of its budgetary requirements and financial conditions and I have already been in correspondence with the President.
estimate		This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.
estimate		The most important argument is, however, that fishermen can indeed estimate their catches within an accuracy level of 3%.
estimate		It is difficult enough for the Union to estimate its own stocks, let alone for the developing countries who have to do this without the benefit of the West's advanced technology.
excuse		Nonetheless, the debate on the most fundamental reforms in the run-up to 2004 cannot be an excuse for refusing to immediately adopt the reforms that the Council can already implement in the existing Treaty. Furthermore, one of the objectives set out in the White Paper is to ensure the Council functions as efficiently as possible.
excuse		I think it is irresponsible to allow Chernobyl to run for even one more day, or perhaps to use it as an excuse for the construction of two more, equally problematic, nuclear power stations.
excuse		Obviously the uncertainty as to the fate of the Lisbon Treaty affecting the budget for 2009 does not excuse us from applying the other principles governing establishment of the expenditure plan for 2009.
excuse		The gradual process discussed in paragraph 4 is a risky institutional venture, pure and simple, and will surely end in institutional tears, if you will excuse the pun.
excuse		Our aim is to deal with this report most speedily so as not to give the Council any excuse for not moving rapidly to the conclusion of its initial debate on overall simplification - again a point raised in the joint resolution.
excuse		I would say that it is no excuse that Member States in some cases deliberately drag their feet on implementation of employment non-discrimination, but it is an excuse, and the Commission must not allow the slowest to dictate the speed of the rest.
excuse		Although the final text approved in plenary is more restrained than the original proposal and does have some positive aspects, we do not agree with other points, namely when environmental protection is used as an excuse for yet another opportunity to step up the ideological offensive, to lay the responsibility on ordinary people and workers, and to commercialise all environmental activity and make it profitable.
excuse		Are we expected to accept the same excuse this month?
excuse		The excuse used by some candidate countries - that we should not get excited about it because they are not exporting to the EU at present, and are actually buying products in Ukraine and Russia - will no longer be relevant.
excuse		We must address this because the Lisbon Treaty could make us work more effectively, more democratically, although we must not use it as an excuse for failing to respond immediately to the needs of our citizens.
excuse		That, however, should not be an excuse for the EU, which ought to be able to make a political effort to build a united, cohesive leadership, overcoming the opposing geographical blocs that are often to be seen within it.
excuse		I believe that the crisis should not be an excuse to water down donors' aid promises, and I will insist on remaining committed to delivering the promised aid levels, both for EU Member States as well as other donors.
excuse		When the government has spectacularly failed - and it no longer has any excuse, it is incapable of showing a single result after two whole years - and the market situation remains as it is, the PSD has no other option but to be on the side of the solution.
excuse		I would only like to say that Mr Avgerinos and I were invited yesterday to a meeting and on that occasion he ask me to excuse him.
excuse		I hope you will excuse me that in answering the questions together, I take slightly longer.
excuse		I am less impressed with the way in which the Council of the European Union is full of the importance of involving the citizen in the European Union, but subsequently fobs us off with an excuse when it comes to funding the Europe for the citizens programme.
excuse		(FR) Excuse me, but you have unfortunately forgotten the original wording of paragraph 45.
excuse		There can be no excuse not to tackle violence against women in a decisive and committed manner, because a society cannot progress while the rights of such a significant section of it – women – are being breached.
excuse		Canada's indigenous population has been used as an excuse for the Canadian Government's inertia in the international negotiations on new trapping standards.
excuse		We can excuse prejudices or we can oppose them.
excuse		Excuse me, but could you put the question in a different way?
excuse		If he will excuse me, I will overlook the commonplace, the popularity-seeking proposals and pious wishes which fill his report for, what concerns us most in this expressed desire to renounce a development policy which remains under the control of Member States, is the substance.
excuse		You will excuse me, Mr President, I mean no lack of respect to Mr Watson, whom I like a lot, but I could not help thinking of Sherlock Holmes and his faithful ally, Dr Watson.
excuse		Excuse me for saying so, but refugees are important for the Hungarian Presidency for historical reasons because it was for Hungary, in 1956, that the first concerted effort was made by the international community to resettle thousands of refugees.
excuse		Unfortunately, the Commission confines itself in the REACH plan to pronouncements alone, while it delays the definition of legislative measures and special headings for their application with the excuse that more research is needed.
excuse		Finally, I agree with you that they must commit to implementing policies consistent with ILO fundamental principles and rights and they must not allow the current economic crisis to be used as an excuse to weaken or disregard internationally recognised labour standards.
excuse		We should consider that the demand for a very rapid acceptance of the whole acquis could also result in the fact that applicant countries commit themselves to something which they cannot then carry out or that the environment is used as an excuse to postpone the entire eastward enlargement of the EU.
excuse		No doubt well intentioned, this report needs to be reduced to identifying and eliminating whatever it is that is killing our bees, and to allow the international community to deal with it, not to serve as an excuse for more and more and more EU regulation.
excuse		There are those who think that hawkish Thai generals are using it as an excuse to overthrow the government and to cancel the elections proposed for later this year.
excuse		On the contrary, I think it gives our citizens an excuse to portray the common agricultural policy in the most negative way, referring to the old-fashioned methods and tools that we used in previous times.
exploit		in writing. - (FR) The general prohibition of employing unauthorised workers to deter illegal immigration can only be viewed favourably, just as sanctions against employers who resort to such workers - often to exploit them - can only be viewed favourably; such employers are nothing more than modern-day slave-traders.
exploit		There will undoubtedly be a great deal of work to do with those who will try to bill for 'euro-related' services and those who will try to exploit more vulnerable groups of people.
exploit		All that is left is the desire to exploit a rapidly growing market economy in an attempt to keep state power in the hands of an aged and corrupt party elite in a one-party state.
exploit		It is a strategy of using human rights that involves an attempt to exploit the United Nations Human Rights Council, where the idea is to isolate those countries that do not kowtow to the dictates of imperialism.
exploit		An end to analogue TV broadcasts and a total changeover to digital TV are important if we are to be able to exploit the limited resource of the radio spectrum in an effective way.
exploit		Let me remind some of my colleagues of the role played by these laws: by prohibiting certain practices, they set limits intended to protect those persons, male and female, who for different reasons are easy targets for criminal networks which exploit, and prosper on, their poverty.
exploit		This policy must allow us to pursue and sentence those who exploit human beings. It must also help us to ensure that the most fundamental rights of any immigrants in our countries, be they legal or illegal, will be respected, even in instances where they have to be expelled or returned to their country of origin.
exploit		There is no rule of law in Belarus, only the rule of those who simply exploit the law.
exploit		We also welcome your proposal to set minimum penalties for employers who exploit immigrants by forcing them to work illegally.
exploit		The young have many abilities and advantages in learning which sometimes they do not fully exploit, but older people must find willpower and receive encouragement because it is never too late to acquire knowledge and they can compensate for things for which, perhaps, there was no time or money in their youth.
exploit		Coming to the crux of this report, I would emphasise that it is our duty - instead of carrying on these disputes that resemble the cockfights in Manzoni's famous novel - it is the duty of our Member States not to give in to the siren calls of do-goodery, peppered perhaps with hypocrisy and very specific political and economic interests, but to force ourselves very strictly to apply the sacrosanct principle of asylum, and in so doing not to give up any ground to those who wish to use it for improper purposes that are not in accordance with the noble principles that inspire it, and to prevent its exploitation, which favours precisely those criminal organisations that organise and exploit the trade in illegal immigrants, to which we refer in the context of the current situation.
exploit		Above all, I should like to add that there is no need to allow China to exploit existing disagreements between the European Union and the United States on that issue.
exploit		Mr President, here is another chance for Turkey to exploit its strategic position and use its proverbial military capabilities: let us hope that, this time, its attachment to the West will be more effectively translated into vital internal reforms.
exploit		Only a structured partnership with the competent national authorities will enable us to exploit this strategy to its full potential, a strategy which is now co-owned by the institutions, and to ensure that it has maximum impact at regional and even at local level, in the general interests of the Union and for the benefit of all of its people.
exploit		How should we exploit the network in order to ward off a crisis?
exploit		The Commission's R&TD funding programmes aim to exploit this potential in the systems and infrastructures for services too.
exploit		For example, it would remove some of the loopholes by which racists and xenophobes try and exploit religious discrimination in order to cover their racist attitudes.
exploit		We have to let our businesses and industries exploit it to the full.
exploit		I believe that, by means of the conciliation procedure, we have created the right – that is to say, favourable – parameters for ensuring that in the railway sector too there is a European internal market and, now that we have created the parameters, it is now up to the railway companies – whether public or private, on that we are neutral – to exploit, at a high level of safety, the opportunities in the market and at the end of the day to achieve our common objective of reviving rail transport in the European Union and shifting as much freight as possible from road to rail, so that our policy can make sense both environmentally and commercially.
exploit		Granting greater freedom to countries provides an opportunity for them to exploit these potential possibilities.
exploit		It is equally regrettable that the Council has not put in place the measures needed to bring an end to the occupation of Iraq, so as to ensure that the Iraqi people will be able to claim their inalienable right to determine their own future and exploit their rich resources.
exploit		You will see that we are basically satisfied that this framework of Staff Regulations will deliver the core parts of the reform: the move to a personnel system where members of staff in all the European institutions will be properly compensated, will be able to exploit their talents and encouraged to progress their careers in a system that rewards their efforts.
exploit		Its basic objective is to turn these countries into its satellites, penetrate their markets and exploit their people and wealth.
exploit		Fourthly, we must do everything possible to exploit information and communications technology properly.
exploit		They will be able to exploit a little more the suffering men and women who are often paid less than 100 dollars a month.
exploit		It is a good thing that they will now get the chance to exploit their competitive advantage of greater environmental protection in the internal market.
exploit		We have to become stronger, we have to exploit our potential fully – economically, but clearly also in terms of foreign policy.
exploit		The message we need from the Spring European Council is that Europe has made a credible commitment to structural reforms and is determined to exploit fully all its potential for growth and more and better jobs.
exploit		For that reason we need to establish priorities, exploit the applicant countries' own resources, and implement tailor-made solutions.
exploit		I hope that the honourable Member, like others, will not only seek to exploit the information that we are able eventually to provide but to see that it is applied effectively at local level.
exploit		If, though, we want to exploit the efficiency gains of an internal market, then what we need is not the addition of 15 submarkets, but an integrated, common, internal market.
exploit		Irrespective of what develops as regards the transatlantic issue of European and US stock exchanges or purely European ones, it is important to exploit the opportunity we now have.
exploit		I believe in making sure that we do not over-exploit some of those fish stocks.
exploit		What I would like the Commission to do is exploit this transitional period to the full by telling Serbia that we are not going to carry on delivering aid unless they solve this pressing problem.
export		Madam President, the European Commission has initiated the process of concluding voluntary partnership agreements with countries which export timber to the European Union.
export		The Commission and Council are currently reviewing the legislative framework - called the 'Arrangement on officially supported export credits' - to transfer it into EU law.
export		This reasoning conceals a major risk, because it seems the Union is going to conduct its export policy along the same lines.
export		During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.
export		We have, of course, made a perfectly credible and serious offer concerning agricultural tariffs linked to proposals we have made in respect of domestic subsidies and the elimination of export subsidies.
export		The reform of the sector must take account of the specific characteristics of wine production at regional and national level, the structure and organisation of the sector, its export capacity and the fact that it may be the only product to which Community legislation applies with a high degree of subsidiarity.
export		Fifthly and finally, you need to put a floor in the market for our intensive sector, with export refunds extended immediately to meat and hams.
export		These cases are inseparable from a common agricultural policy (CAP) that promotes intensive, export-oriented production models, instead of encouraging, as is necessary, local production and consumption, which could ensure much more effective traceability and, consequently, greater food security.
export		Here we have export refunds from the period 1991-1994 totalling over ECU 11 billion. That amount was actually more than the total spent on training, social policies, research and development, and anti-poverty programmes.
export		Due to the one-sided consideration of export interests, we are back where we were half a century ago.
export		Fourthly, there are of course also factors that fall under the sphere of influence of developing countries themselves, such as good management and a strong economic structure. A greater diversity of export products forms part of this.
export		Mr President, hundreds of thousands of healthy animals are being killed in the name of export.
export		What this means is that China will issue an export licence for all exports and, in parallel, the EU licensing offices in the Member States will issue an import licence.
export		It is not simply a question of costs; it is also a question of quality and particularly of benefits for others; it is not so much a question of export surpluses, in any case not in a large European Economic Area whose export quota is under 10 %.
export		The third point which I think is extremely important is that, although the European Union is now an export market for synthetic drugs and candidate countries are buying from it, having become transit countries and countries of destination, we need to make all the instruments at our disposal immediately available to the candidate countries so that we can create a larger area of security, which is our goal.
export		In the agriculture sector, the EU has already acted: we have sold intervention stocks, reduced export refunds, abolished the need for set-aside in 2008, increased milk quotas and suspended import duty on cereals.
export		Henceforth, fishermen will be able to receive their payments irrespective of the destruction or export of the vessel on which they worked.
export		In conclusion, allow me to mention three facts: we need production for domestic consumption and for export on the basis of a reformed system of land tenure; we need better employment; we need sustainable management and we should consider new ways forward.
export		Given that animal welfare is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency, and given that countries such as Ireland have already put in place successful animal welfare schemes in relation to the live transportation of animals, including the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme which helps to ensure that our weanlings for export are stronger and better prepared to cope with the journey, has the Swedish Presidency any plans to take into account schemes such as these for the live export of animals in order to ensure that a balance is reached between the sustainable export of live animals and the safeguarding of animal welfare in any new legislation?
export		Subject: Export refunds Having noted the answer to my previous question (H-0280/00), that 'the Commission simply proposes to adapt the calculation system used in order to take into account the price differences on the world market and in the Community for the cereals used as raw materials in relation to Export Refunds, does the Commission agree that the proposals to change the methodology for calculating the level of export refund rates affecting spirit drinks producers should be accompanied by a detailed explanation as to how this is to be achieved along with supporting justification?
export		The Community provides an export refund, which reduces the difference between the higher Community price and the world price.
export		I think the only solution is for the EU to cut the refund made for the export of live animals.
export		Does the Commission realise that, by withdrawing the export refund entitlement for chemical products derived from agricultural raw materials, it has further seriously impaired the competitiveness of the European chemical industry which is already deprived of the economies of scale enjoyed by the glucose suppliers of its US counterparts as a result of the EU quota system for isoglucose and the lack of an ethanol programme in the EU?
export		Fraud has also been detected in quantities exported with the export refund.
export		Export refund are economic nonsense.
export		The export refund on live animals fits in with Union policy incredibly badly.
export		Today we have heard that overproduction of beef in the EU area, as a result, for example, of BSE, is the commonly given reason for the transportation of live animals and the export refund.
export		The first is to set ourselves a date, a deadline - we are proposing 2015 - by which to lift these exemptions, launching a real withdrawal strategy, including measures that will then be required to demolish these plants in safety and also ensure safety as regards export.
export		Fifthly, the development of weapons export control legislation, demobilisation programmes for militias and support for the ownership committee.
export		I would like to say, as I come from Northern Ireland where our beef farmers have suffered greatly from the export ban on UK beef, that I hope that both the Commission and the Council will face up to their responsibilities.
export		Another role of the veterinary inspectors is to monitor the export of trade of live cattle to third countries under the export refund scheme.
export		Animals should be protected from cruelty regardless of cost, but under one condition: that we apply the conditions of the European Union to all those who export their animal products to the European market.
export		It also seems to me that, internally, the approach to access of third parties to the network is of doubtful utility because of the shortage of potentially competing national producers and because the external producers export through a single company and do not have the financial resources to construct their own pipelines.
export		That is, of course, an internal UK problem but it is aggravated by the advantage that exists for other Member States to export into our market.
export		But the European Union needs also to cooperate with the new parliament and the new government; and resources need to be used not just to produce consumer goods for export but also to produce consumer goods for use within Albania itself, to secure lasting and sustainable development.
export		The issue was actually taken up by the western European nuclear lobby, which was intending to use its own extremely expensive experts and export its own equipment, with disastrous results on the ground.
export		But when these products are taken out of storage, it is compulsory to export them to third countries.
expose		After the split on the war in Iraq, the ‘stupid’ affair of the Stability Pact and the breakdown of the Brussels Summit on the Constitution, we now have the debate on the budget to expose in a new and edifying way just how bad things really are.
expose		On the contrary, officials who expose deficiencies rather than being prepared to conceal them are sidelined and hit with disciplinary proceedings.
expose		Journalists have the right to expose wrongdoings, human rights lawyers have the right enshrined in international law to represent people in courts.
expose		There is no good reason not to expose Greece or other countries which are lax in this area.
expose		This is the only solution that guarantees that the required environmental effect is achieved and that does not expose European carriers to a drastic fall in competitiveness.
expose		The employers made the profits which they clearly do not wish to surrender while the workers, if they expose the exploitation, face deportation.
expose		This is a consultation procedure, and I think this process is in fact intended to help expose the problems facing not only the Commission, but also the citizens of Europe, and I believe we can all sympathise with one another.
expose		I think that this view should be listened to, for the major argument in the debate against a ban on oktaBDE and dekaBDE is that we cannot expose people to the danger involved in not using adequate flame retardants in buildings, furniture etc. At the same time, we know, however, that there are substitutes, that there is the possibility of using other materials and that there is the ability to produce in different ways than we do today.
expose		It is not even because Portuguese women still have to go to court to expose their pain and their intimate details in a humiliating ordeal.
expose		Faced with this situation, unfortunately, most countries are trying to meet the convergence criteria, not by reforming their administrations but by increasing taxes, braking growth even further, something that could expose the growth concerned to serious political problems, as has just been seen in France.
expose		People must continue to take responsibility for whether or not they expose themselves to natural radiation.
expose		Because it is not enough simply to expose the responsibilities and disastrous slackness of the Commission - they must be penalized.
expose		That method, however, will not expose the economy and jobs to bureaucracy, unfair competition or unforeseen price fluctuations.
expose		For example, proposals in this House for a Common Members' Statute would expose Members of this House to criticism from national members of parliament in their own country if MEPs were to be paid significantly more.
expose		The rhetoric on which the Danish Government's endorsement of the United States is based is so absurd that only a major ironist could expose it, as my fellow MEP did so brilliantly, it being understood that what is so surreal about this debate is that the EU has no common foreign policy and that this Parliament would in any case have no influence over such a policy.
expose		Mr President, the Greens have spent more than a decade endeavouring to expose the myths at the heart of the free-trade theory.
expose		You say that some of the advertisements are false or expose children to danger.
expose		Recent problems with energy supply expose our weakness, vulnerability and dependence on third parties.
expose		However, I would really like to expose another issue, an issue that is endemic in that state and that carries on regardless of changes of government.
expose		I can assure him that the Council is not going to act like some candid camera running round Europe seeking to expose breaches of commitments.
expose		The ELDR Group will make every effort to expose the weaknesses in the Regulation in the mean time, and to contribute to the improvement thereof.
expose		I want therefore to read this into the record to once again expose the type of behaviour that Mr Martin engages.
expose		They prefer to remain silent rather than expose themselves against the trendy phrase, which the Thaler report rightly remarks, is liable to increase tensions.
fragment		I fear that all this work will fragment and there will be unnecessary overlap.
fragment		This fragment of the resolution is very important, but sadly the conclusions are not optimistic.
fragment		We must encourage a more careful and respectful attitude towards every fragment of humankind, because only in that way will it be possible to triumph over hatred and violence.
fragment		This policy is a uniform European-wide programme, and forcing national governments to contribute up to 25 % of the agricultural budget would clearly fragment and distort the workings of the CAP.
fragment		They fragment the market and can lead to a shift in activities to the cheapest region.
fragment		They fragment the EU and are it also takes time to make decisions in the third pillar.
fragment		Many have trusted that this kind of advancement will bridge the divides that fragment the human condition. As if our achievements had given us the power to overcome the fundamental realities of our moral and - may we say - our spiritual condition.
fragment		I hope that we will confront some obstacles in this structural context of support to small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the diversity of national laws, including rules and tax systems that fragment the market resulting in higher compliance costs for businesses to shoulder.
fragment		Finally, Mr President, I should like to respond to a comment made by Mr López-Istúriz White, to whom I listened carefully, and by Mrs Lichtenberger. They said that this enhanced cooperation, which currently involves 25 of the 27 Member States, could be used to fragment the single market.
fragment		But it is also a medicine to be taken sparingly and carefully: too large a dose, and the Union will fragment.
fragment		Without that, we will be exposed to different threats and attempts to divide us, to fragment us.
fragment		We cannot defend the European project by attacking the single market and trying to fragment what has been one of the greatest achievements of our integration in Europe.
fragment		We have just witnessed the Commission's strong commitment to communitising and standardising control, and it would prove difficult to understand the way in which the remaining measures serve, on the contrary, to break up and fragment that control, or the fact that different rules are created for the same activity, depending on where it is carried out.
fragment		Alongside them there are the so-called individual systems, operating on a regional basis or limited to particular chains of supermarkets, but, as these do not constitute a self-sufficient whole, their effect is to wholly fragment the can deposit system.
fragment		In the global economy, it is important to strengthen the European market, rather than fragment and weaken it.
fragment		The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, second part, 11 and 13, as they would fragment the internal market.
fragment		Some would like to ban all forms of autonomy because they claim this would fragment the EU.
fragment		This year I shall be drafting a report on the monitoring of Community law and therefore feel very passionately that in moving to codes of conduct we have to ensure we still have legal certainty and enforceability or we fragment the very gains we have made in the internal market.
fragment		I got just the last fragment, which seemed to suggest that we had suspended the operation of the trade defence instruments and that we were no longer initiating or pursuing cases.
fragment		Enlargement will certainly not improve this situation, as it will further fragment the European judicial area, increase the number of administrative bodies involved in the management of Community funds and accordingly increase the risk of fraud.
frequent		Reports and evidence of torture, humiliation and abuse are not just increasing, but they are becoming increasingly frequent and alarming.
frequent		denounces the frequent lack of any parliamentary scrutiny over the negotiation and approval of these agreements, with national parliamentary approval only being required in seven Member States;
frequent		One quite frequent irregularity is that projects have been approved without an environmental impact assessment being made first.
frequent		Indistinct or disputed boundaries are a frequent source of disaster.
frequent		Regrettable though this is in view of the frequent invocation of the soul of Europe, I would like, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, to ask the House to back these proposals tomorrow with a large majority.
frequent		Mr President, as someone who suffers from a neurological complaint, to wit Parkinson's disease, I am naturally biased in this matter, but I am a little shocked by the frequent use of terms like 'unacceptable' and 'dignity' applied to people who wish to find a solution through medical research to the terrible problems facing those who suffer from neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone and Parkinson's.
frequent		The most frequent criticism that we hear is that there is too much regulation from Brussels, too many restrictions and too much red tape.
frequent		Preventive measures, therefore, such as frequent periodic inspections of migratory birds and of poultry farms are of vital importance in this instance and I welcome all the efforts made to date to detect cases immediately in different countries.
frequent		This report, which the European Parliament adopted by a huge majority, has been on ice for over two years, because it is being blocked by the Council, despite the fact that citizens are calling increasingly loudly for European solidarity against the background of the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters.
frequent		The changes include a fundamental difference in the nature of armed conflicts, and more frequent occurrence of natural disasters whose effects are increasingly painful.
frequent		Too much knowledge leads to all too frequent interventions, and this could blacken the prospects for the economy.
frequent		For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.
frequent		I still have frequent occasion to quote the slogan of the French Ski Schools, which says that ‘pleasure has to be learnt’.
frequent		in writing. - (PT) As has been pointed out, the whole of southern Europe is delimited by the edge of two tectonic plates that cross the Mediterranean and go on through the Atlantic Ocean via some of the Azores Islands, which means that earthquakes are one of the most frequent natural disasters in this region.
frequent		I think she has proved it with her frequent presence in this House.
frequent		Unfortunately, there is a very great need for it: the facts show that this need is becoming increasingly pressing because of natural disasters, which we should no longer look on as natural, but rather as increasingly frequent occurrences in our lives.
frequent		Unfortunately, conditions of extreme drought and forest fires in southern Europe have been growing both more frequent and more intense.
frequent		I welcome the Commission's proposal to establish an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund resources, following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created as a separate, specific instrument with its own aims and deadlines, and that suitable budget lines for transfers must therefore be identified.
frequent		It is hopelessly outdated and is characterised by frequent and long delays and by overcrowded carriages during peak hours.
frequent		That is now an obligation incumbent on the Member States, who must now carry out more frequent checks, so that the sort of scandals in the haulage industry with which we used to be familiar, and the serious accidents caused by cumulative driving fatigue, will at last be consigned to the past.
frequent		Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that we in this Parliament are some of the most frequent users of air transport requires us to pay special attention to all initiatives designed to improve the organisation, punctuality and safety of air traffic navigation and control services.
frequent		The evaluations will be far more frequent and will be clearer.
frequent		Frequent experience has shown that the economy, which is the main beneficiary from the harmonisation of the EU internal market, participates in these rules, and indisputably has urgent need of them, and therefore we MEPs must support this process.
frequent		Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on their excellent work on uniting efforts to create instruments that will enable us to combat the increasing volume and the frequent cross-border effects of crimes against the environment.
frequent		Many of the people are disabled, miscarriages are so frequent that they are no longer accounted for, and diseases such as cancer are rife.
frequent		We are very pleased to see her as a frequent visitor to Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation.
frequent		It is certainly more wide-ranging and frequent and of greater depth than I was used to as a minister in my national parliament.
frequent		Next, the agreement is well-balanced: it makes frequent references to the Commission’s own commitments but also notes the commitments of Parliament and the Council concerning improving the quality of regulations.
frequent		It is based on this attitude of the 'superiority' of the 'values' and conduct of the EU that frequent attempts are made to use election observation missions as an instrument of pressure and interference in the internal affairs of countries, mainly those which insist on development projects based on an affirmation of national sovereignty and independence.
frequent		Courts are dealing with international and cross-border evidence law on an increasingly frequent basis.
frequent		The news which comes from Vietnam - I have three little Vietnamese godchildren - is frequent and always concerns the violent repression of all freedoms and the bloody repression of all demonstrations, but then two-thirds of this Assembly fought for so-called peace in Vietnam.
graduate		in writing. - (IT) Considering that the risk of social exclusion in rural areas is greater for women than for men, and considering the significance of this, I strongly support this resolution, which draws attention to the role of women in agriculture and demands not only that women's agricultural and non-agricultural professional competencies be given more prominence in business and regional development strategies, but also encourages incentives for the promotion of women's involvement in the market by eliminating all types of discrimination, improving available training and access to post-graduate and specialist courses.
graduate		Don' t worry,' I told her. 'You study hard for the next three years, and as soon as you graduate I will tell them so they can all give you a round of applause.'
graduate		(PL) Mr President, speaking as a law graduate and former police officer, I would like to stress the importance of the Council framework decision, whose objective is to oblige all forensic laboratories supplying the results of genetic and fingerprint tests to observe the ISO 17025 international standard.
graduate		As a graduate in Arabic studies, I have been greatly alarmed in recent months, weeks and days at Russia’s growing ambitions in the Middle East.
graduate		You do not have to be a graduate to understand that.
graduate		Let us not forget that the Social Chapter started out life as a social charter and that a public services charter may well graduate into a stronger commitment by the EU to deliver public service provision, based on a strong dialogue between employers, employees, consumers and operators.
graduate		Where the GSP is a success, a country may graduate to a new relationship with the EU.
graduate		I would also like to underline that due to the dynamic market, the fast-changing working environment and the ever-increasing development of new technologies, institutions of higher education also have to adapt to the new changes - they must improve and reform curricula in order to ensure a high level of education and solve the question of graduate employment.
graduate		Is the Council aware that the United States of America's National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has stripped graduate teachers at American private universities of the protection of US labour law?
graduate		However, 10 years later, we have not achieved the goals we set and only two of the 48 countries that make up the LDC block have managed to graduate from LDC status.
graduate		I recognise, however, that there are two positive points in this report. Firstly, the drafting of a Green Paper, as long as it does not become an instrument for standardizing our universities, and secondly, granting post-graduate study grants on the basis of merit rather than household income.
graduate		There are too many instances of failure at school, inadequate training and graduate unemployment in Europe.
graduate		It creates education 'consortia' on the basis of the 'objective of excellence' and imposes tuition fees on students, thereby essentially excluding children from working class families from higher education and post-graduate studies.
impact		Crop yields fluctuate from one year to the next, heavily influenced by the variation in extreme climate conditions, which has an implicit impact on every sector of the economy, although agriculture remains the most vulnerable.
impact		What struck me is that the proposal by the European Commission on the roadmap on reform of the common agricultural policy reflects the lack of priority that the latter gives to the social impact of its plan since this impact only features in seventh place in the list of proposed measures.
impact		The papers always maintain that things would degenerate into chaos or that it would have a negative impact on Europe's financial market if we suddenly rejected this directive.
impact		But if we do not have a financial perspective, and if the evaluation that is going to be made of the effectiveness and the positive impact of the Peace Facility – an evaluation which will obviously prove to be very interesting and very positive – concludes that we need to allocate more funds to this Peace Facility when there is no financial perspective, I wonder whether one solution might perhaps be to use certain uncommitted funds, to convert resources that are already committed, resources that we know full well will not be used for some time, as a means of provisionally replenishing the Peace Facility.
impact		It deplores the dramatic impact that the current crisis is having on the population and is alarmed that the political dispute may degenerate into ethnic conflict.
impact		In general, we Ministers of the Interior prefer to deal with the purely human and negative impact; in other words, we put the plaster on the wound.
impact		Today we approved a programme on motor oils and its impact on emission levels for cars, a joint proposal by my colleagues Mrs Bjerregaard and Mr Papoutsis and myself, and I have no doubt that Mr Barton will tear it to shreds. He will ask how we came to set such low limit values.
impact		At the same time, however, it is directly associated with the objectives for mitigating the impact of climate change, whether by helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions, retain and ensure satisfactory management of water resources, or by boosting production and decentralising sustainable, renewable energy sources.
impact		We need to define together actions at European Union level to complement national actions with positive social impact.
impact		At the moment of impact, these weapons unleash chemical reactions, whose effects upon soldiers, civilians and the environment are still not known.
impact		The crisis is further intensified by the adverse impact of the climate change and by the shortage of such natural resources as water and energy.
impact		Even if the EU moves closer to its 10% target, the impact on food prices will be limited, in particular for two reasons: first, more and more biofuels will come from non-food feedstocks or will be made from residues or waste.
impact		The reform will have an extremely serious social impact in these countries, due to the very special role played by sugar cane cultivation: a social, economic, cultural and environmental role.
impact		We also need to do this because Commissioner Almunia himself has recognised that that questions of exchange rates, oil prices and the real impact on the EU economy of the sub-prime lending crisis will affect the Union's projected economic growth.
impact		Impact assessment remains, I would stress, a highly political issue, on which we even risked losing some of our prerogatives during the negotiations, binding ourselves too rigidly to an obligation to complete an impact assessment which, in practice, we are still not technically in a position to do.
impact		In the case of Georgia, the impact of the crisis has been exacerbated by the direct and indirect consequences of the military conflict that occurred last year with Russia, including a large number of people who were displaced within the country.
impact		What we are being called upon to debate is when, how and with what environmental impact we decide to mine it.
impact		Before their adoption, all EU provisions must be examined in terms of their impact on SMEs.
impact		Furthermore, comprehensive health impact assessments and evaluation on all legislation across the board should be carried out, in order to provide a platform for joined-up thinking and better enable decision-makers to assess the real cost to human health of any policy initiative.
impact		We would hope that the Commission will read carefully those requests that appear in the report inter alia to measure the net impact on the environment.
impact		These views are reflected in my vote on Marcin Libicki's report on the environmental impact of the planned gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea to link up Russia and Germany.
impact		Mr President, Mrs Zimmer, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Zimmer on her report on the impact of the European Investment Bank’s activities in developing countries.
impact		I wish to stress the importance of concerted action on the part of the Union and all Member States on human rights, because on this issue there remain a great many contradictions that diminish the moral authority of the Union's political system in negotiations and weaken the impact of European policy.
impact		The recent report by the European Investment Bank that our rapporteur mentioned confirms the value, viability and potentially positive impact of such a fund on our cinema and television industry.
impact		However, there are times when particular airline rules, or, indeed, the attitude of a captain, can have a very negative impact on the travelling experience.
impact		With regard to the impact of Basel III on both major and smaller banks, generally speaking, we will proceed very carefully with macro- and micro-economic impact studies, without improvising, and I will use all flexibility margins in order to develop good measures and good decisions that are as well-gauged as possible.
impact		Further to what Mr Doorn has had to say on the subject, I think it is crucial that decisions arrived at by way of comitology also need to have their impact assessed.
impact		This programme was designed, in the impact assessment, such that one euro of subsidy granted under Marco Polo II will generate more than six euros in terms of social and environmental benefits for society.
impact		The Agency also takes part in the decision-making process in that it provides the European institutions with the information needed to adopt legislation in the social field and, more importantly, information on the impact of that legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises.
impact		In July 2009, the Commission invited an independent contractor to evaluate the first three years' application of the Culture Programme 2007-2009 and, more importantly, the consistency of objectives, the initial results and the initial impact of the programme.
impact		Economic growth is slowing, haunted by the impact on GDP of past banking-sector crises in Sweden or Finland or Hungary or Spain, to say nothing of Argentina or Japan.
impact		What impact will such a financial transaction tax have on the real economy and on the competitiveness of the economic and financial position of the European Union?
impact		In the short term, these new policies could have a significant impact on European citizens' lives in most Member States.
impact		No more so, by the way, than they are concerned about finding out whether the objectives headlined when these texts were adopted have been achieved, whether the impact analyses have proved accurate, and whether the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality have been respected.
impact		– Mr President, one of the European Council’s tasks will be to conduct an impact assessment on the Lisbon strategy, and, in this, it would do well to ponder the lesson contained – or so I see it – in the document addressed to it by the Commission, which shows how the free-market approach that characterises the EU’s current policies is incompatible with an advanced social model based on the non-elitist and inclusive encouragement of people’s abilities.
impact		According to the Commission, this package contains measures that will impact on 22 industries with an aggregate annual output in the region of EUR 1 500 billion.
impact		These impact analyses must be comparable: they must therefore be standardised.
impact		No more impact assessments, no more prevarication, no more national egoism: for goodness' sake act!
impact		I believe that the examination of the impact on this industry, occupying what might still be called a small niche in the market, is rather important, which is why we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr Garot for putting his finger on the wound straight away and calling on the Commission to take the lead and do something positive.
impact		in writing. - I voted in favour of the final text of the resolution because it included our petitions to the EU Commission to take into account in its 2010-2014 roadmap not only the economic and financial crisis but also the impact of climate change on women; on the fact that inequality and gender stereotypes in the EU still persist with women remaining in a position subordinate to men in the areas addressed in the Beijing Platform; and because it promotes gender equality especially in terms of paternity leave.
impact		It is not sufficient simply to reduce discards, as bottom-trawling in deep water has a relatively high impact on by-catch and discard species.
impact		The environmental impact of the spillage of oil derivatives into the strait was exacerbated by the rapid dispersion of the pollutants due to the strong winds and high waves at the time.
impact		In doing so, we also call upon the Commission to promote a study on the impact of this situation on those regions as soon as possible.
impact		The proposal has no impact on the EU budget and is uncontroversial.
impact		in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Aviation Safety Agency but urge the Agency to implement an activity-based structure for the operational budget in order to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts and improve performance monitoring and reporting; note that the Agency prepares a multiannual plan every year, discussed with all stakeholders and approved by the Management Board, in which the budget per activity is presented; and acknowledge the view of the Court of Auditors that the structure of the Agency's operational budget (Title III) remained partially input-related and that the budget amendments were made without updating the work programme, even when they had a significant impact on the allocation of human and financial resources
impact		Secondly, I believe that Mr McCreevy was absolutely right to point out that we should not be legislating for the sake of legislating - our failure in relation to the European Company should give us cause for concern in this regard - and the impact study is therefore clearly necessary.
impact		Notwithstanding the occasional criticisms made of NEPAD for its top-down approach, I feel that we must give the initiative our wholehearted support and must contribute towards improving its effective human and social impact.
impact		You have also passed provisions on maternity pay that are going to have a severe impact on my constituents within the UK.
impact		Such legislation has an enormous impact, in terms of ensuring that the fundamental rights of women are upheld and women are encouraged to achieve their full potential. This must apply not only to women but also to families, children and, consequently, to the future of our European societies.
impact		The Commission should submit the proposal for this as soon as possible so as to allow all the different aspects and complexities of the Generalised System of Preferences to be properly analysed, along with its impact on different areas and countries.
impact		This has had an adverse impact on unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and the increase in social and territorial inequality, borne out by the 20 million unemployed and the 70 million or so people living below the poverty line, whilst the large corporations in the EU saw their profits rise by 78% in 2004, and profits as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone are currently close to a 25-year high.
impact		We must reach an agreement which will guarantee the integrity of the borders in the Balkans, a request that has been put forward by all the Balkan countries: Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and Romania. Only if a specific agreement can be reached on how to solve the problem of the autonomy of the region will we be able to say that military presence will have a positive impact.
implant		We need research and further development work to be carried out on safety and implant toleration.
implant		The patient register is an important proposal as it will help in future research but also to reach women who may be felt to be at risk in the event of any future problem with a particular implant.
implant		So there are at least three reasons to justify this action being taken at Community level: improving information for patients in certain cases; shedding the maximum possible light on the potential secondary effects of having a breast implant, in particular by means of research; and, of course, taking into account the petitions presented by citizens' groups, giving consideration to whether or not their request that silicon implants of this sort be subject to an immediate ban is well founded.
implant		My group is also calling for an implant passport to be introduced, which would give information both about the characteristics of the implant and about the necessary post-operative care and would identify the surgeon.
implant		This lady herself had to have a mastectomy for preventative cancer reasons and she has had a very successful implant.
implant		Moreover, such a system would, above all, allow the patient to have real knowledge of the implant's specific characteristics.
implant		What we do want is to ensure that she is properly informed and that she knows what the disadvantages and potential dangers of a breast implant are.
implant		In the light of the many complications that can arise after breast implant operations - which were brought to our attention not least by the petitions sent in by thousands of women in 1998 - I think it is quite frankly scandalous and completely incomprehensible that so far only one Member State has introduced a national implant register.
implant		This report concerns a private and sensitive subject for many women who, either for aesthetic or medical reasons, have had breast implant operations carried out.
implant		I have voted against items 19-21, in which the European Parliament '[r]ecommends urgently that details of breast implant operations should be recorded in the EU by compulsory National Breast Implant Registration in each Member State'.
implant		It will come as no surprise either then to learn that at the moment we do not have either precise figures on the implant operations carried out or complete scientific findings based on the adverse effects suffered by the women.
implant		The constant physical and emotional suffering caused by the implant operations is often immense.
implant		By way of conclusion, Madam President, I would like to thank you for putting up with this little aside and say that, as far as silicone breast implants are concerned, if there is one category for which it is imperative that we introduce preventive measures to combat the risks engendered by breast implants - the sometimes negative effects of which in the field of health are, in spite of everything, still not well-known - it is precisely the category of young girls who, at 15 or 16 years old maybe, compare themselves with the women they see on various television programmes and attempt to improve their appearance by having, even at that tender age, a breast implant operation.
implant		We in the Environment Committee believe that all breast implant operations should be recorded in the EU and that, as a result, manufacturers should supply only to surgeons who use such a register.
implant		Here the introduction of a passport for implant recipients and compulsory aftercare examinations might also be helpful for gathering data.
implant		Therefore, the creation of a national breast implant registration to keep women informed in the event of a product fault is vital.
implant		In this context, the EU Member States should be advised to become members of the international breast implant register.
implant		Breast implant advertising specifically - indeed implant advertising of any kind - should be regulated.
implant		Incidentally, 80% of breast implant operations are carried out for purely cosmetic reasons.
implant		There was, however, a clear indication of the various kinds of inconvenience caused to women who wanted, or felt obliged, to undergo implant operations.
implant		Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every year, tens of thousands of women undergo surgery for the insertion of at least one breast implant.
implant		It also means that breast-implant producers need to trace their products.
implant		Europe must not prescribe a 'national breast-implant register' or annual 'compulsory aftercare examinations'.
implement		This means that not only do the Member States transpose the directives into national legislation, they are also the ones who actually implement this national legislation.
implement		It will not be easy to implement this directive and I am not referring to the votes.
implement		Finally, as regards the recurring question of comitology, the Commission considers that one major issue is its having the possibility to take measures to implement or adjust annexes, so that they can take account of current scientific developments.
implement		The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.
implement		Pending this, the EU Member States should implement unilateral actions to prohibit the use and transfer of these bombs, as many states have already done and others are preparing to do.
implement		Member States should be aware of the need to implement such projects urgently, in order to prevent the anticipated collapse of goods transport systems within the Union.
implement		We have to make an effort to implement and complete the 1997 legislative programme; we need to fight unemployment through a range of effective policies able to promote the competitiveness of industry in the Union, regional, transport and environmental policy, a real effort to complete the internal market and identify an investment policy apt to stimulate economic activity; we need to fight fraud; the Commission must put a stop to shortcomings or abuses on the part of a Member State by suspending payments, recovering sums illegally obtained and imposing the requisite penalties.
implement		It is important in your meetings at regional and local level to remind the regions that, even if there are not yet implementing rules in place, the recent example of France and Belgium clearly shows that the EGTC can be established and a Member State can implement and designate an ad hoc authority to play the role of the authority to which the regional and local bodies would direct themselves for information about the establishment of the EGTC.
implement		The European Union therefore needs to implement information campaigns, and to take action by making use of Community funds, incentives and information campaigns, and by applying and researching new production technologies.
implement		By July of next year it must be clear to what extent car manufacturers are obliged to implement the EEVC test method.
implement		I support paragraph 21 of the report which calls on the EU to implement the Nabucco project fully and as quickly as possible.
implement		It has to implement proper economic reforms.
implement		Moreover, the debate on this communication could not have come at a better time since, following the agreement on the protocol at Kyoto, the Commission is now very actively engaged in further reflections on how best to implement the commitments it has made with respect to emission reduction.
implement		Furthermore, we need to implement this measure with special care and responsibility, taking into account the situation in terms of human resources in certain fields in the countries these migrants originate from, so as not to deepen the human resources crisis further, particularly in the education and health sectors.
implement		The FVO reports highlight the considerable efforts made by Member States to implement the rules.
implement		Twenty-six countries have become eligible for debt relief now, having reached what is known as the decision point, and can now benefit directly from the cut in debt servicing, but to officially exploit this relief, reaching the completion point - which has currently only been reached by four countries, moreover - they must implement a pre-established package of social and structural reforms and maintain sound macroeconomic performance.
implement		I believe, therefore, that we should try to implement a consistent, serious policy on this matter, probably by taking a different approach entirely.
implement		Why are we not glad that the Union is willing and able to implement important programmes like Galileo?
implement		Therefore it is our task today not just to rely on attractive plans, but to show the political will to actually implement those plans.
implement		It is not easy to implement approaches where we combine money from the Member States with Community funding, but it is definitely worthwhile, because that is exactly the direction in which we should go in the future.
implement		Financial assistance must support the population and must support the reforms which the country has to implement, as encouraged by the Union.
implement		The PrepCom in New York is the last chance to implement this programme before the next review conference in 2005.
implement		(LT) We are aware of the fact that the aim of the European Neighbourhood Policy is to create a secure circle of safety and stability around the European Union, to develop close relations with neighbouring countries as well as to enable these countries to implement democratic reforms, based on respect for human rights, the rule of law and economic and social development.
implement		Moreover, none of the EU’s institutions has shown an ability to implement the eminently necessary change of course.
implement		in writing. - I voted for this resolution which reaffirms the urgent need for Russia to implement fundamental principles of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and media freedom as a basis for cooperation, and calls on Russia to take concrete action to improve its human rights record and to protect journalists, human rights activists, minorities and opposition representatives from violence and intimidation.
implement		Proper integration can only be achieved through involving the Roma community, the Roma themselves, in other words, those people who, along with the local authorities, have the ability and, in particular, the desire to implement the programmes.
implement		It was therefore necessary to update and strengthen protection through compulsory cover for victims of accidents caused by one motor vehicle, and to ensure greater convergence in the way in which Member States interpret and implement the directive.
implement		On the one hand, the original institutions implemented by the Lomé Conventions and confirmed by the Cotonou Convention, notably the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, have manifestly endured and are livelier than ever, and the report by Mrs Flesch clearly shows the innovative developments in the Joint Assembly in 2003. At the same time, however, the objectives and the substance of the cooperation, which these institutions are there to implement, are tending to weaken, degenerate, be trivialised, break apart and dissolve, to the point where, soon – if we let this carry on – they will consist only of financial aid with an upper limit and of standard free trade agreements that could be more a source of difficulty for the ACP countries than real instruments to aid their development.
implement		It is therefore right to implement the necessary controls at border crossings in order to regulate the influx of those seeking visas and asylum, but we cannot, however, avoid adopting a global approach of solidarity and respect for human rights, particularly in humanitarian crisis situations, such as in the recent cases of the tsunami and of Darfur.
implement		We are to have a security policy worthy of the name, implement administrative reforms and, hopefully, win back some of the confidence our citizens have lost in the European project.
implement		Having achieved economic and monetary union, other plans are now being drawn up. We cannot take 50 years to implement these, however.
implement		Even if the other institutions implement their plans in preparation for enlargement, and even if Parliament faces higher costs because, by that stage, preparations will have got well and truly under way, in my opinion it will then be difficult to remain within the established ceiling.
implement		Heads of State and of Government have highlighted that by stating that we must not wait for ratification of the new treaty to implement the measures set out in the chapter on employment.
import		The rapporteur urges the Commission to cut the import subsidy for one third of the countries involved.
import		An instrument must be created to standardise the rules applicable to the trade in cat and dog fur, and products containing such fur, on the Community market and to place a complete ban on its use, import or export in the Community area.
import		Nevertheless, in terms of international trade, the report points out that if import and export rules and procedures are too strict, this can represent a non-tariff barrier to trade.
import		I would apportion the blame between the British Government and the Commission for not imposing a minimum import price.
import		With the current legislature coming to an end, it is vital that the Commission take swift action, in response to Written Declaration 38, by publishing a proposal to ban the import and export of and trade in seal products.
import		I would add that, based on past experience, the cases most representative of this situation might be, for example: the untimely and unjustified prohibition of importing products from other Member States; measures establishing or restoring import formalities, such as licences or technical approvals; destruction of large quantities of products from other Member States, for example, on the roads, in shopping centres or in warehouses; or even the immobilization of products by not permitting access to the national territory or movement within it, for example, blockading means of transport at the borders, on the motorways, or at the ports or airports.
import		I also thank my colleagues and my political group for supporting an amendment I tabled concerning the need to pay attention to SMEs, which regard the difficulties in applying import and export procedures as one of the main non-tariff barriers to trade.
import		(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, it is like customs night here tonight, with Mr Markov's report on the GSP and Mr Audy's report on non-tariff barriers, in other words these import and export rules and procedures which we call administrative protectionism, or self-righteous customs barriers.
import		A number of your amendments, such as the increase of import volumes and the obligatory price refund, have my complete support.
import		These rules of origin – this is child’s play for you, of course – state that Israel is not permitted to sell products from the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as though they originated from Israel itself; otherwise, the products from the illegal settlements would wrongfully benefit from favourable import duties in Europe.
import		Please do not tell me that EUR 1.50 cannot be absorbed across the supply chain by importers and retailers, especially importers and retailers who have benefited from low import prices from China and Vietnam but who have not passed on the effects of those cheaper import prices to consumers – a question that consumers may put to their retailers if they are able to encounter them at some stage in the future.
import		As far as I understand it, the preferential import from these territories constitutes a violation of Community law.
import		The Commission is aiming, among other things, to support the unification of import rules by harmonising the rules on textile imports with the rules on imports of other industrial products. This should improve the overall cohesion of the legislative environment in this area.
import		As regards the legal base, the Commission considers that the voluntary import licensing system should be implemented on the basis of Article 133 of the Treaty, on commercial policy.
import		No option on our agenda should be neglected in order to reduce our energy import dependency.
import		This requires more purposeful, more uniform and clearer regulations in order to ensure that comparable import checks are carried out at all the external borders.
import		What would really be effective is if we had a trade import ban on China; that would really cause headaches to the Communist leaders in Beijing and would lead to some sensible responses to our demands for freedom for Tibet.
import		We need to make full use of the potential that we already have so that trade and industry cannot import huge numbers of cheap foreign specialists on the pretext of there being a lack of skilled workers.
import		Besides, let us not forget that when push comes to shove, there is no need to import arms from abroad: machetes can be used for killing and murdering.
import		This means that it is difficult to import bananas from countries other than those in Africa, the Caribbean or the Pacific Ocean, or, to put it another way, those countries that were colonies of the Member States up to half a century ago, unless they fall within the scope of import licences held by a number of big undertakings in Europe and America.
import		The United States has stood in the way of an agreement, and is even pressuring some countries to give up the right to import generic medicines.
import		Imported food and feed will be submitted to import controls upon arrival.
import		This crisis has also profoundly affected European sea fishing, because we import 60% of our fish from third countries.
import		As has already been said, Europe produces only about one-fifth of its protein needs and we import soya to fill that gap.
import		The second point I would like to make to you is that we are a net importer from the developing countries, which means that we import more agricultural produce from these states than we export to them - an immense contrast to the states I just mentioned, which are all great net exporters.
import		Import escalation rates of up to 700 % are currently being quoted.
incline		One has the impression - as Mrs Guigou said a few moments ago - that the IGC may incline to a minimal reform, pending the arrival of monetary union.
incline		I hope you will not incline too much towards the US, for example on environmental issues.
incline		This should incline you to self-criticism, rather than to the unbounded propaganda of success.
incline		First, incline for loading ramps should not exceed 20º according to the Scientific Veterinary Committee (1992).
incline		The ramps used to date had between a 30- and 40º incline.
incline		Unfortunately, this relationship – including after Mr Alexander's statement – tends thoughtlessly, ungracefully and even illegally to incline very dangerously towards the former and away from the latter.
incline		I would add that we should not incline towards the simple idea that the Central Bank, as the monetary authority, is the only body responsible for price stability and the fight against inflation.
incline		In conclusion, I applaud the initiative of the Commission in making this proposal, and I emphasize that, over and above the differences of opinion, it is a matter for each Member State, while endeavouring to achieve a maximum of harmonization, to decide which summer-time system to apply, always bearing in mind that common sense must incline us to believe that time differences between contiguous Member States - and this was the sense of the amendment tabled by Mr Wijsenbeek - should not exceed one hour.
incline		At such times, people's emotions incline them to desire a very different outcome.
incline		I agree with the position put forward by Mr von Boetticher on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but I must also add my own personal view: in terms of protecting the interests of consumers, I incline more towards the Commission' s proposal than to that tabled by Mr Cappato, more towards the opt-in solution than towards opting out.
incline		I personally incline more to the 'aggressive journalist' tendency, and, in my professional life, have found, rather, that you only get anywhere by going straight to the point and really piling on the pressure.
increment		The EU ratio of felling to increment is stable at around 60%.
increment		The ratio of felling to increment is stable throughout the Union, and is in the region of 60%, but this ratio is projected to increase to more than 100% in some countries, with, as a result, a reduction in standing timber after 2010.
increment		We also disagree with the monthly increment being paid in November, since harvest time in Greece is in June.
initiate		I want to see some lessons learned: the Council must finally abandon its blocking tactics and initiate a joint communication or PR strategy with the Commission and Parliament so that we can genuinely take citizens with us on our journey to Europe instead of leaving them by the wayside.
initiate		Yes to having sufficient time to initiate reforms, but also yes to beginning these important steps as soon as possible, in order that we can get away from the bad light in which the Commission, and indeed the whole European Union, is portrayed.
initiate		So rather than initiate a European process on subjects that are new, you allow the Member States time to adopt their own proposals, which then makes the development of European governance more complicated.
initiate		The Commission must initiate work on a thorough report analysing everything related to the problem of honesty in gambling and all the legal and social consequences associated with this.
initiate		Do you believe that it is possible to initiate dedicated research programmes into the detection of landmines?
initiate		In order to gain a detailed insight into the matter, it is high time for the Commission and Council to provide access to all existing reports and initiate the further investigations which Parliament has been urging since 2001.
initiate		We demand that Russia initiate negotiations with Chechnya' s elected President without unrealistic prior conditions and that the aid which the EU has also promised should actually get through.
initiate		In the light of this information, will the Commission initiate legal proceedings against the Irish Government for altering the boundaries of an SPA, and will it urge the Government to redesignate the entire SPA as it was first advertised in July 1999?
initiate		I would then go on to say that the Commission, pursuant to Article 13 of the Council Decision of 31 October 1994 on budgetary discipline, should initiate proceedings forthwith to suspend or reduce monthly advances in this sector.
initiate		We must also start to collectively think about children' s living conditions in the various European countries particularly in urban areas, and initiate a form of collaboration as well as financial resources in order to help families in difficulty, particularly in the case of single-parent families or of vulnerable parents.
initiate		Where appropriate, the Commission may initiate infringement proceedings against any Member State that fails to transpose Community law correctly.
initiate		Let me also tell you that the Austrian Presidency of the Council did indeed initiate a new discussion of principle, at the informal Salzburg Council, where we considered how we could involve states that do not at present have any prospect of accession in a special partnership system, for instance a partnership for Europe, similar to the NATO partnership for peace.
initiate		We want to support the WTO accession request, initiate negotiations for an EU-Iraq agreement on trade and cooperation and progress on the opening of the Commission delegation in Baghdad in 2006.
initiate		The time then is ripe for reflection on the future development of the AFSJ, and the European Parliament therefore calls on the Commission to initiate a wide-ranging debate involving all interested parties, including, in particular, judges and practitioners.
initiate		It is true that the common position calls on us to initiate that political dialogue but, I repeat, with the military junta this has not been possible.
initiate		We, the European Parliament, should call on the Commission to initiate negotiations with the Russian authorities on a number of important issues which are listed in our draft resolution.
initiate		What steps has the Council or Commission made to calculate the cost of compensation or to initiate talks with complaining countries to seek to find an alternative means of maintaining the market for small banana producers?
initiate		I believe, in fact, that it is logical to apply to this Treaty the same principles we wish to apply to the Community Treaty, but I wonder and would ask honourable Members whether the Conference will agree to initiate discussion on the subject of this Treaty.
initiate		As I am sure Mr Barrot will say, the Commission can initiate appropriate proceedings if it considers that a Member State is not complying with primary or secondary legislation.
initiate		The underlying concept aims to establish an internal market where its economic players can freely initiate and exercise their activities.
initiate		We might take an example from a country like Switzerland, where the people can indeed initiate the legislative process.
initiate		By implying in its judgment that MEPs who are nonetheless discriminated against are welcome to initiate new legal proceedings, the Court is doubtless concerned to ensure that the principle of equality is observed to the full.
initiate		The communication states that the Commission will make full use of its powers to ensure that the Member States apply EU law, in full respect of fundamental rights, and that you will not hesitate to initiate infringement procedures.
initiate		I should like to see the Union take action sustained by the will to initiate a process of democratisation, in particular, with regard to greater participation by women in public life and better planning of socio-economic development.
initiate		It is a widespread concern in this regard: I therefore call upon you to initiate a final debate, no longer on roles so much as on the political content of Parliament and the Commission' s initiative: definite, clear-cut choices which describe a Europe in which the memory of the cucumbers - to which President Prodi referred - is increasingly faint and remote.
initiate		Parliament should also initiate an investigation in this connection.
initiate		Not only have you managed to initiate yourself into the mysterious technical terminology of computerized reservation systems, but you have also managed to propose a series of amendments which substantially improve the proposal.
initiate		I believe that petitions could become an important tool for the exercise of citizenship and the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of persons and institutions and I find the idea put forward by the rapporteur that it could be possible 'for citizens to initiate reform of Community law through petitioning the European Parliament? extremely interesting.
initiate		First and foremost, there is a need to initiate and encourage a new approach to the elderly within society, and I consider it very important that this approach should serve to prevent discrimination against older employees and the elderly in general.
initiate		Mr President, I wish to focus this debate on the ongoing work of the Council to prepare and initiate the external relations service in advance of ratification and adoption of the Constitution, for it is the Constitution which validates that service.
initiate		All these agreements were forged, Mr President, on the understanding that if any person physically, legally or morally belonging to the European Union was affected, or if the conceded annulments did not happen or were altered, the European Union reserved the automatic right to re-initiate the normal WTO complaint procedure.
initiate		Just as I call on those who are holding our fellow citizens to release them immediately, given the possibility of their release, I urge the Angolan authorities not to initiate or intensify military operations that could put the lives of the Portuguese who are being held at risk.
insult		The proposed measure, which is a vulgar insult to the dignity of man and his very personality and, at the same time, puts his health at serious risk, reveals yet again the real, repulsive face of the EU of capital.
insult		We will not insult the Commission in such a way.
insult		Enlargement by the addition of ten countries in the absence of a Constitution is an insult to the European citizens, for they must be central in this year of rejoicing for Europe – and the way in which you have worded your work programme leads me to have complete confidence in you.
insult		. – The very title of the debate is an insult to the people mourning the dead from the new imperialist order of affairs and an insult to the workers of the EU who pay dearly for arms.
insult		As someone who fought to see Europe exist, I, for my part, believe that this is an insult to us.
insult		Approaching this with anything less than caution would be an insult to the people of my home country and of all of Europe who are facing their own budgetary concerns.
insult		It is a brazen insult to the millions of dead and injured, the victims of fascist and Nazi bestiality in Greece and Europe as a whole, for the European Union to try and wipe out and falsify history: to turn 9 May from a day of anti-fascist grassroots victory into a vulgar celebration as Europe Day, a day which celebrates the European monopolies.
insult		The references in the report to poverty, the environment, workers' rights, health and the like are an insult to the peoples who are suffering under imperialist domination and capitalist exploitation.
insult		The report is an insult to the intelligence of the working classes and the grassroots classes, which are suffering under the barbaric war unleashed on them by capital and its political representatives.
insult		The hypocritical interest of the American and European imperialists in the terrorist attack, human rights and democracy in Afghanistan is an insult and mockery of history, because it was they who supported politically, morally, financially and militarily the blindest and most reactionary of forces, in order to block the path of the Afghan people towards progress and turn the country into an advanced military base.
insult		This is grotesque and an affront to this House but, far more importantly, it is an insult to the terrorised and starving people of Zimbabwe, whose lives and livelihoods have been destroyed by the actions of the Mugabe regime.
insult		This is an insult to taxpayers.
insult		That is an insult to all those who perished in the Holocaust, and I ask you to protest against it.
insult		It is an insult to Austria when a million citizens who vote for the Freedom Party are dismissed as racists and ostracized in this European Parliament document.
insult		Allow me to use my last two minutes to express some richly deserved thanks: thank you first of all to all the fellow Members who have spoken today. My especial thanks to those who have said that they will be supporting the text, but to those who will not be voting in favour, I do not believe that putting me in the same bracket as Mr Cameron is really an insult either.
insult		In Turkish criminal law, it is a crime to insult what is termed 'Turkish identity'.
insult		The resolution adopted is an insult of the first magnitude to the Cypriot people, in that it calls on them 'to be fully responsible, consistent and committed to their status as EU citizens'.
insult		Not only is this an insult to the Irish voters that rejected the Lisbon Treaty by a wide majority during the referendum, it is also an attempt to interpret the Lisbon Treaty in such a way that it would 'confer legal personality upon the EU', thus making it a superstate.
insult		He believed that attachment of the assets of military personnel was an insult to the military profession.
insult		To deny that it happens, frankly, is an insult to our intelligence.
insult		One of them has now been relieved of that position by the sovereign population of my country and he will therefore no longer be Head of Government when any insult is directed at him.
insult		It would be a democratic indignity for Europe, a surrender to the thinking of the ETA-Batasuna terrorists and, above all, a betrayal of the victims of terrorism and an insult to their memory.
insult		It is also an absolute insult to the southern European economies, which may have the impression that it is a question of a lack of money in the countries in question.
insult		Mr President, it is an insult to our conscience and political ethics that, after the military intervention by NATO and the European Union against Yugoslavia, under a humanitarian flag, as a result of the unforgivable ethnic cleansing by Yugoslavia against the Albanians, we are now remaining calm and accepting the violence against the Serbs, gypsies and other minorities, this time on the part of the Albanians, which, furthermore, is of an even higher proportion.
insult		That is an insult to unemployed people and those on low incomes and they will realize that.
insult		What is happening is an insult to Europe.
insult		They no doubt knew, in any case, what the letter contained, and they obviously perceived it as a threat. It does in fact dishonour Parliament and is an insult to this House to turn tail and evade responsibility, as Mr Kinnock is now doing.
insult		Mr President, could I just thank James Elles for his observations in relation to the comments made by Mr Bloom and suggest to my UKIP colleagues that, if they do want to make a point or have a disagreement with colleagues, they do not need to insult us to make that point.
insult		To insult either of them would be to insult the peace process.
insult		B4-0501/96 by Mr Imbeni and Mrs d'Ancona, on behalf of PSE Group, on the insult to the memory of the victims of the extermination camp at Auschwitz; -B4-0509/96 by Mrs Lalumière, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the insult to the memory of the victims of Auschwitz; -B4-0511/96 by Mr Nordmann and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on respect for the memory of the victims of Auschwitz; -B4-0517/96 by Mrs Roth and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the demonstration by the extreme right on the site of the former concentration camp at Auschwitz; -B4-0529/96 by Mrs Seillier and others, on behalf of the EDN Group, on the desecration of the site of Auschwitz-Birkenau; -B4-0533/96, by Mr Pasty and Mr Ligabue, on behalf of the UPE Group, on respect for the site of Auschwitz; -B4-0534/96, by Mr Provan and Mr van Velzen, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the insult to the memory of the victims of the camp at Auschwitz; -B4-0540/96 by Mr Piquet and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the desecration of the concentration camp at Auschwitz.
insult		Purists could never accuse it of being franglais, not that I would ever dare to offer such an insult to the members of the Académie .
intrigue		Much as all of us long to see a democratic regime in Iraq, delaying the consolidation of Kurdish autonomy until then leaves a vacuum in which the murderous intrigue of recent years can continue.
intrigue		It has been like the dénouement of a bad Aristotelian play, because there has been no deus ex machina , just intrigue leading to the calamity and the final outcome we are now witnessing.
intrigue		As far as the East is concerned, our policy relates to an area that is constantly troubled by intrigue organised by the Russian Federation, whether this is obvious or hidden.
intrigue		The Irish people in their great wisdom have rejected that Treaty by democratic vote, and although people in Brussels and people here in Strasbourg will work and cajole and bribe and intrigue to try and persuade the Irish to change their minds, the decision of the people should prevail, and in this case Ireland has stood for the people of Europe.
intrigue		We are unhappy that this crisis is damaging the reputation not just of the Region of Campania but of Italy as a whole, but keeping quiet again about who is responsible and turning a blind eye would do little to resolve a problem which has worsened because of silence and intrigue, and although people should not used as political pawns, nor do I think that the do-gooder attitude that is also creeping round this House this evening is acceptable either.
invalid		The manipulated referendum results should be declared invalid, and the people of Irian Jaya should decide on their future at the earliest opportunity.
invalid		Reinsurance companies are not subject to the European solvency regulations and other European insurance regulations, so that that is from the outset invalid as an argument for equality in this respect.
invalid		The ridiculous statistics produced by the Commission on the basis of invalid calculations cannot disguise the fact that if Mrs Kroes had been in Mr Monti’s post, she would have had to stand aside in no less than 35 cases.
invalid		More than six years after the vote which gave victory to the Islamic Salvation Front was ruled invalid, Algeria lives in fear of tomorrow.
invalid		This has a disadvantage due, firstly, to the fact that the text on tickets is the result of a universal regulation and it would be invalid or would represent an excuse for the companies, and due, secondly, to the fact that there are already many companies which do not issue tickets, but which notify confirmation of the booking by fax.
invalid		I simply sat by mistake in the seat of another Member who has an inserted card and I voted from his card, which is against our rules of procedure, so please could it go on record that I am in favour of the motion and that the vote of my fellow Member is invalid.
invalid		My understanding is that the President has the discretion to rule that any request for a roll-call vote be declared invalid.
invalid		To avoid the possibility of our vote being declared invalid, since we do not yet have the opinion of the Committee of the Regions, I suggest that we postpone the vote until tomorrow.
invalid		This creates great legal uncertainty as it leaves in limbo, and apparently invalid themselves, laws passed under that constitution including in respect of Hungary's accession and EU membership.
invalid		For this reason, all reproaches are invalid.
invalid		If they do, they are invalid and should be disregarded.
invalid		I quote: 'Notes that the assignment contract between Manpower and the European Parliament is invalid; notes that the project contract between Manpower with the employees is invalid; states and rules that the contractual relationship between the applicant employee and the European Parliament should be put on a permanent contract footing'.
invalid		Therefore, we could not adopt an act which, from what you are saying, is invalid according to the July 1988 decision.
invalid		It is up to Great Britain to go before the Court of Justice to have these decisions ruled to be invalid.
invalid		Voting slips that were not filled in or were invalid: 69
invalid		According to our Rules of Procedure, a vote is invalid if the text is not available.
invalid		Such decisions outside the institutional framework should be invalid: they would invalidate the political and institutional role played by the European Parliament.
invalid		At this point, it is obvious that the worker is no longer needed and the Blue Card then becomes invalid.
invert		Our rapporteur is of the opinion that these amendments impair the original text but we, of course, feel that they enhance it. I will mention just one in particular - the amendment seeking to invert the onus of proof and transfer it from the defendant to the prosecution.
invert		It must be seen as highly negative. In my opinion, if we invert this trend, we will be doing a great favour to both our economy and Parliament.
invert		(IT) Mr President, so as not to interrupt the vote on the Fava report, which as we all know will be a complex vote, I should like to ask whether it might be possible, if the House agrees, to invert the order of business and thus vote first on the simpler and briefer reports and go on to vote on the Fava report after President Napolitano's speech.
invite		We are perfectly well aware that Mr Mugabe's presence was guaranteed by the African Union's desire not to be restricted by the other party, i.e. the European party, in its choice of whom to invite.
invite		I invite you now to observe a minute's silence in their memory.
invite		I invite you to observe one minute's silence for our colleague Pieter Dankert.
invite		That is why I would invite all of you once again - and in particular my colleague and shadow rapporteur from the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrat) and European Democrats, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo - to take another look at Amendment No 39.
invite		I therefore invite the Socialist Group to withdraw Amendment No 51, and if this is not possible, I invite the House to vote against it.
invite		I also call upon the President to express and pass on our sympathy and support to those who have been kidnapped, and their families, and for him to invite the skipper of the vessel, once he has been freed, to Parliament.
invite		All the speakers talked of Lampedusa, but I would like to invite you to reflect on what the kind of migratory process we are experiencing at present really means for an island that lives on tourism and fishing.
invite		As far as television is concerned, I invite you to watch the programmes by Giovanni Floris, Michele Santoro and Fabio Fazio: only then will you be in a position to vote on this resolution.
invite		I now invite you to listen to the anthem of the European Union.
invite		Mr President, I would invite Parliament to avail itself of Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure and refer the report back to committee to pursue negotiations with the Commission.
invite	invite_vrb	I should like to point out at this juncture that if colleagues wish to raise other cases involving the defence of parliamentary immunity, I invite them to take these cases up with the relevant committee, namely the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
invite	invite_vrb	Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I invite you to reply to Mr McCartin's question.
invite	invite_vrb	I therefore invite Mr Ford to inform himself better before making unfounded insinuations, and in any case I invite the President, or whoever is responsible, to investigate the incident fully.
invite	invite_vrb	I invite the President to set up a working party which must, I suspect, work over the Christmas period to produce some proposals as to how this system will work.
invite	invite_vrb	The Ghent 'triumvirate' , which did not even invite the High Representative for European foreign policy, did not have this objective, concerned as they were - and are - with fighting for their leadership or the next elections.
invite	invite_vrb	This is sufficient cause not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU summit, in response to the appeals of the Belarusian opposition.
invite	invite_vrb	I should therefore like to invite Mr Poettering and the other leaders of the Group of the European People’s Party, for example Mr Karas, whom I can see in the Chamber, to come to the Czech Republic and urge the pro-European Czech forces to ratify the European Constitution.
invite	invite_vrb	That is why this stocktaking exercise actually does nothing other than invite us to join up procedures even more closely, and to support the Commission's streamlining initiative in economic, employment and social policy so that we gain even better instruments in these fields.
invite	invite_vrb	"Therefore, I would like to take this exceptional opportunity to invite all the countries of the world community to fully implement the principle of what has been called ""shared responsibility"" , in order to combat the global problem of drugs."
invite	invite_vrb	We have pointed the way, and now all we can do, Commissioner, is to invite you to follow it.
invite	invite_vrb	Thirdly, it might also be possible to invite all the groups in the Verkhovna Rada to come here and have a debate.
invite	invite_vrb	One million signatures are needed - only 0.2% of our citizens - to invite the European Commission to act in matters that concern them directly.
invite	invite_vrb	In this perspective, I think one should invite the Court to evaluate how significant an impact the errors have had.
invite	invite_vrb	I would invite the Commission to investigate such a scenario which, unfortunately, was not investigated for various other legal and political reasons.
invite	invite_vrb	With particular reference to two areas of European policy, namely rural policy and forestry policy, I should like to invite the Commissioner to consider whether we can deploy these policy measures more effectively in those regions that are being hit by drought or other climate-related disasters in the long term.
invite	invite_vrb	Furthermore, the way in which we are going to work together, and whom we invite, is also our decision - in consultation with the European Council, of course.
invite	invite_vrb	They need to invite us and we need to provide our partnership of know-how.
invite	invite_vrb	For yourself and the leader of a political group to invite him and for him to turn you down would imply that somehow he is refusing to come before this House.
isolate	isolate	Iran is a great country and we do not want it to isolate itself from the international community.
isolate	isolate	Nonetheless, I should like to point out that until we isolate producers from distributors and introduce radical changes to the penal code to create an effective deterrent for people who make a living out of drugs, this problem will not be reduced.
isolate	isolate	The absence of a common EU energy policy and common energy sources (electricity, gas), coupled with a lack of solidarity on the part of EU Member States, threatens to isolate Lithuania from energy suppliers.
isolate	isolate	Those who wish to continue to kill and torture opponents unhindered, have every reason to demonise and isolate the democratic opposition that has been driven into exile.
isolate	isolate	The European Union's strategy must be to isolate Iran as much as possible in the region.
isolate	isolate	From this point of view, we cannot isolate the revitalization of the railway system from the other issues being examined by the European Union. I am thinking, for example, of the subject that has been rightly raised regarding the internationalization of costs.
isolate	isolate	The report also describes the worsening human rights situation in Russia but sounds a warning against any moves to isolate that country.
isolate	isolate	The question at the moment is how best to push Cuba towards democracy; after 40 years of embargo, and now with the European Union’s sanctions, we can see that this method is not effective and that the best way to help Cuban society is not to isolate it, but rather to create increasingly close and strong relations with Cuban civil society, to help the NGOs in society.
isolate	isolate	With globalisation and interdependence, it is clear that no wall can isolate the European Union from its closest neighbour countries; hence the importance of an active and generous neighbourhood policy.
isolate	isolate	Lastly, the effect of a crisis in NATO will isolate the Europeans, and will reinforce the United States' tendency to act unilaterally.
isolate	isolate	We want the Council under this presidency later this month to take a whole range of initiatives to isolate Burma.
isolate	isolate	But, seriously, computers have a great deal to offer elderly people, especially for rural dwellers or those whose health tends to isolate them.
isolate	isolate	Can we isolate one country, but not the other?
isolate	isolate	The debate was constructive and thought provoking, and it made it clear that we cannot isolate ourselves.
isolate	isolate	In short, a more active and subtle approach is required, which makes it possible to isolate an undemocratic government without isolating society.
isolate	isolate	It is wrong to isolate software-related inventions as a sector in its own right.
isolate	isolate	But there is a second principle we must see as well. In my opinion it makes little sense to isolate fleet policy from the rest of the common fisheries policy.
isolate	isolate	This resolution calls for coordinated action between the EU, the UN and the African Union to isolate pirates in the region and ensure aid reaches this troubled region.
isolate	isolate	Like these countries, the EU has maintained that a policy which aims to isolate Belarus would militate against its own objective.
isolate	isolate	We have to be satisfied with the outcome of the summit inasmuch as the extremist countries in the EU and the American fundamentalists did not receive support for their calls to isolate Russia.
isolate	isolate	Again, these are common sense measures because they do not want to exclude groups of people, nor do they wish to further isolate regions that are already classified as less-favoured regions.
isolate	isolate	We need to clear the territories of mines and, most importantly, we must isolate the terrorist groups which are present or have established themselves in the country. Moreover, we must define an institutional structure and set in motion a process of introducing democracy and respect for human rights.
isolate	isolate	We demand a total overhaul and review of the whole of the common agricultural policy, so it is difficult to isolate individual areas such as the one we are now to vote on.
isolate	isolate	We believe that, at this moment in history, one of the ways in which the European Union can combat and isolate any form of violence is to make a concerted effort to achieve the objective of giving the peoples of Israel and Palestine two autonomous, sovereign States, as stipulated in all those UN resolutions which Israel has been violating for years.
isolate	isolate	We cannot isolate a nation-state of 1.3 billion people.
isolate	isolate	The will of the United States to isolate such states in the defence of democracy is not well-served by the undemocratic arrogation unto themselves of a presumption to act and to choose for all.
isolate	isolate	We need to help to bring about this opportunity by supporting the independent media which can expose Milosevic, and we need to isolate Milosevic as an interlocutor.
isolate	isolate	But I would say that you can never isolate that from other facts if you calculate the effects of abolishing tax-free sales on ferries.
isolate	isolate	These are all clear signs that the international community does not intend to isolate or marginalise North Korea.
isolate	isolate	It is of crucial importance, however, that we do not wish to isolate the forces of change internationally in ancient Persia.
isolate	isolate	To help them, we must isolate its leader, Mugabe, from his African supporters by getting all African leaders to condemn him.
isolate	isolate	That is why it is important for cultural ties to be used creatively for the purpose of communication and exchanges and not, of course, to isolate a community; this would be particularly negative and we have seen it happen in the past.
isolate	isolate	The criticism is sometimes levelled at us that, with our policy and our resolutions, we are trying to isolate Belarus, and that this is only playing into Lukashenko's hands.
isolate	isolate	Collectively we must defend our rights to choose when and how to engage, or isolate, regimes such as those in Cuba, Libya, Iran or elsewhere.
isolate	isolate	We believe that it is almost impossible to isolate this sector of the market, even if it were desirable in terms of maintaining the service's necessary general economic balance.
isolate	isolate	Let us bring the moderate parties round the table and isolate the extremists.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Perhaps that will lead in time to support for the peace process and negotiations.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	The work done on revising the directive, which is also geared to new developments, should lead to greater coherence on Europe's financial markets and above all to more trust on the part of investors: the outlook is therefore good for a particularly sensitive area of our globalised economy.
lead	None	However, it should not lead to a situation a minor defect is viewed as a further violation of the principle of durability.
lead	None	The Council' s compromise proposal is likely to lead to increased emissions of all four air pollutants in the directive.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	The new accreditation scheme for organisations whose products are certified as conforming to harmonised standards will entail administrative costs but will lead to a better result, a working internal market and more equal conditions of competition.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	National solutions like those proposed by some Member States would only lead to imbalances.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	That is phraseology that would immediately lead to a discussion about deferral.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	After all, they would enable Poles to offer their services in the Netherlands at Polish prices without being subject to prices current in our country, and this would, in fact, lead to social dumping.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	The report notes the existence of overlapping directives that might lead to contradictory and duplicate requirements.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Live animals are still exported and imported on a scale and in ways which would not have happened if the EU's own policies, its agricultural policy, did not lead to it and support it in the form of export and transport subsidies, and thereby encourage it to continue as it does.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Madam President, we in Parliament are rightly particularly attentive to areas where ethnic tensions lead to conflict and attempts to overthrow democracy and the rule of law.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	I voted in favour of this report and would highlight that the 2.3% increase in Parliament's budget provided for is lower than the inflation forecast of 2.8% for the EU, which will lead to a 0.5% cut in real terms for 2012.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Still, at an overall social level, it does lead to decisions that are better than those made without the participation of citizens and their organisations.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Furthermore, this directive does not say anything at all about the specific control that the European Commission exercises over mergers that are likely to lead to misuse of a dominant position, control which, strangely enough, is still opposed to this type of merger when a European company has the dominant position, but much less so when a company from outside Europe has this position.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Enlargement, however, must not lead to a situation where regional policy in the most disadvantaged regions of the current Member States is wound down.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	I would ask my colleagues again to reflect carefully before we accept amendments that will lead to the conciliation procedure and therefore to further delay.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	I am keen that companies should not accumulate preferential instruments and remuneration for conducting the same studies for the same product, which would lead to abuse on too many occasions.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	We must show the way and take a more positive lead. We also need more power at our disposal throughout this process.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	in writing. - I have supported the report lead by our colleague Mikolášik on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation as one very urgent measure to improve the life expectation of more than 60 000 people in Europe waiting for a transplant.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	What is more, the broad definition of interest, which differs from the definitions adopted in the conventions against double taxation, will lead to conflict and even discrimination between financial products that are all much of a muchness.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	They lead to unnecessary additional work for private individuals and companies.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	This can lead to the number of seats in Parliament being increased by one without consultation, whereupon they simply speak of 750 plus one and think this keeps them on the right side of the law.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Offences also play a major role, when they lead to disqualification from driving.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	The high level of arrears, particularly in the field of the structural funds, must lead to a thorough pruning of unprofitable budget lines.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	The public is increasingly sensitive to the theories of environmentalists, which if they are upheld could lead to undesirable effects on biodiversity due to accumulation as a result of a lack of protection on small farms. This could cause serious problems in terms of lack of supply and dependency and could prevent us from seeking solutions for essential uses and lead us to establish parameters that are beyond the limits determined by analysis or to have plant protection products evaluated by interested NGOs.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Some of the concerns aroused by the funds have also been mentioned: more extensive government intervention in economies, intervention that may occasionally be dictated by political rather than economic objectives - which can lead to market distortions and threats to national security - and the national reaction of each government, which could further fragment the internal market.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Firstly there is the size of the budget we have and enlargement, which will also lead to an increase in the mountainous area within the European Union, while at the same time we refuse to produce any resources to finance the very idealistic proposals in this report which most people in this House would subscribe to.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	This will inevitably lead to conflict, even though this would not be necessary if a consensus were to be reached on how to exploit the existing technical options while, at the same time, protecting the natural amenity.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Such a harsh cofinancing programme could lead to certain Member States refusing to pay their national contribution, thereby leading to discrimination within the Union.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	I believe that the action plan against illegal immigration is a good route and that it should lead to many rules which in the future will make us more efficient, but I would also like to point out, as I said at the beginning of my intervention - and this is an aspect which I would like to emphasise in particular - that we must turn the immigration policy into a fundamental element of the European Union's foreign policy, which - I believe - makes absolute sense if we accept, as I believe we are almost all accepting today, that immigration is the most important phenomenon of our times.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not least in the light of the widespread interests of the system of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those of Padania, we feel that the aims - in relation to the Commission's original project, which was already just as dangerous - of imposing one regulation on all of the Member States of the European Union are still very dangerous, because they lead to cut-throat competition in the services sector, which, let us remember, represents 70% of the GDP produced within the European Union.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	But great efforts do not necessarily lead to great results.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	But measures are needed to tighten up the slack administrative practices, to rewrite poor regulations, to cut down complicated payment mechanisms, dispense with excessive exceptions and derogations which lead to the far too many irregularities and errors.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	We should add to that the commitment that the international community should consider making to send in a peace-keeping force to prevent the violence of recent weeks in Gaza from degenerating even further, to re-establish the basic conditions for people to lead normal lives and for international law to be respected, and above all to break the vicious circle of endless violence.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	In relation to institutional affairs, the Finnish Presidency has an enormous responsibility: that of initiating work which will lead to the conclusion of a statute on fundamental rights.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Not only has the Court found evidence of the inadequate performance of checks on payments under shared management, namely agricultural expenditure and structural measures, but it has also found that the Commission has failed to lead by example in respect of EU expenditure managed directly by it, that is to say internal and external policies.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Europe must take the lead in the process referred to by some as the third industrial revolution, the essence of which is to shift to a low-carbon economy.
lead	None	Such an exception would complicate the monitoring of diffuse sources and lead to legal uncertainty.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Only political discussions and free and fair elections can lead any country out of a constitutional crisis.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Furthermore, facilitating the movements of highly qualified workers would lead to an increase in information flow and in useful knowledge in the production areas with high added value, in keeping with the aim of the Lisbon Strategy to transform the European economy into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
lead	lead_nou	I do not understand how cadmium and lead can be banned in certain goods but permitted in toys, when we know how children use them.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	While I do regret having had to listen today to the Austrian Presidency’s critical views of the powers of the European Court of Justice and the fact that such criticism comes now not only from that source, it does lead me to think that the solutions provided in this draft constitution really are very good after all.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	Mr de Grandes, I do not wish my personal circumstances to lead to my interpreting the Rules of Procedure in a biased fashion, because that would be regrettable, and I do not believe that to be the case, Mr de Grandes.
lead	lead_nou-vrb	This might lead people to suspect that we would object to the discharge of accounts regardless of the evidence.
lead	None	I would, moreover, like to echo Mr Watson's words and express our concern and our opposition to the abolition of the Development Council, for this can only lead to development policy becoming even more subordinate to the geopolitical and trade policies of the European Union and, in particular, of its most powerful States.
lead	None	I also want to ask the Commissioner whether he thinks the application of the subsidiarity principle in respect of the allocation of licences might do something to narrow that lead.
lead	None	For example, tens of millions of migrant workers lead lives of shameful misery, with their children suffering the consequences of the horrific conditions under which they live.
learned	learned_vrb	It seems to have learned nothing from it.
learned	learned_vrb	I was totally amazed last week when I learned that only three of the 25 Member States are, in fact, going to implement the Directive as originally intended.
learned	learned_vrb	It was therefore with great delight that we learned at the weekend that debts were to be written off by 18 countries.
learned	learned_vrb	We have learned, for instance, that one Member State allows the inclusion of untreated specified-risk materials in feed mixes, that others are not managing to remove the spinal column at the abattoir and that some of the approved tests have turned out to be rather ineffective in the field.
learned	learned_vrb	I have learned with you and I have learned through you how important this Parliament is in strengthening democracy in our Union and also, naturally, in strengthening the legality of the decisions that we take here with a view, obviously, to creating a freer and more prosperous Union for the citizens of Europe.
learned	learned_vrb	We in Ireland have learned – tragically and dreadfully over a thirty-year period – what it is to live with terrorism.
learned	learned_vrb	In so doing, people in Europe also learned to question their own beliefs and to demand – and give – good reasons for every action, and this process of enlightenment will never come to an end.
learned	learned_vrb	If you do not pay up, the band does not play – that, too, we learned from Mozart.
learned	learned_vrb	We have learned from this experience that it is essential to promote all initiatives which consolidate a stable relationship of confidence between consumers and producers and those who sell food products in general.
learned	learned_vrb	We learned through bitter experience that where there is no opposition, there is no freedom.
learned	learned_vrb	People in Russia have learned to think proudly but live in miserable servitude.
learned	learned_vrb	The Commission and the Council have learned nothing from the continuing worldwide financial crisis which is already a threat to the real economy, to development and to employment.
learned	learned_vrb	Law-abiding citizens have learned to live in fear; many have been permanently threatened in their daily lives.
learned	learned_vrb	Strength in unity', we have learned in Europe, and solidarity works.
learned	learned_vrb	I learned as early as last Thursday that a ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism was to be held here this afternoon before this plenary sitting began.
learned	learned_vrb	This is what we learned.
learned	learned_vrb	What we have learned is that Europe stands or falls together.
learned	learned_vrb	– Mr President, we have learned from investigative journalists that, for the purposes of combating the funding of terrorism, the American authorities have apparently put in place a programme for intercepting the financial transactions handled by the SWIFT bank.
learned	learned_vrb	What we all have to learn is what the peoples of Europe have learned and we are learning in Northern Ireland: difference - whether it is race, religion or nationality - is an accident of birth and is not something we should be engaged in conflict about, it is something we should respect.
learned	learned_vrb	Mr President, what we learned from the Dutch and French referenda was that many people, sadly, see the EU as part of the threat of globalisation, rather than offering a safe haven from its colder winds.
learned	learned_vrb	World peace is something of which we all dream, but we have learned through bitter experience that it was not enough simply to tear down the wall between East and West.
learned	learned_vrb	Unfortunately I have not yet learned the art of walking on water.
learned	None	What we learned from Helsinki – and, thank heaven, on later occasions – has now been incorporated into law.
learned	None	I firmly believe that both the Czechs and the Sudeten Germans have learned from this tragic experience and that the Czechs, Germans and Sudeten Germans want to live together and build a new united Europe together in peace and cooperation.
learned	None	live_vrb
learned	None	Of course, rebuilding Kosovo and intervention in the Western Balkans are matters requiring immediate attention but the question is: have we learned from past mistakes?
learned	None	Secondly, we also have learned a very important lesson from this, namely that the question of energy is of great importance and has to be placed much higher on our political agenda.
learned	learned_vrb	What I have learned so far leads me to the belief that we are quite possibly on the brink of the most far-reaching political reform in the history of modern Turkey.
learned	None	Instead of 'peace for land' , we have learned that on 9 June the Israeli government decided on a new settlement of the Mount of Olives in the heart of East Jerusalem.
learned	None	I believe that the Commission has learned from this regrettable issue of tourism, but that will remain to be seen when the next fraud case comes up.
learned	None	I hope that the Member States have learned with some of the shortcomings of the Lisbon Strategy where, in fact, many, if not all, of the objectives were good and in the right direction but there was not, let us be frank, enough sense of ownership and not enough muscle in the implementation of the programmes.
learned	None	Putin would appear to have learned from the mistakes he made in Ukraine, and the Kyrgyz opposition also acted shrewdly by giving him advance notice of the then Head of Government’s imminent overthrow.
live	None	What really could create trust and encourage further positive developments would be for Varosha to be returned to its original inhabitants and governed by representatives of both communities, and for Cypriots of both ethnicities to live together in Famagusta.
live	live_vrb	They have not become aware of the challenges which require us to live together or of our points in common or even of the substance of our differences.
live	live_adj	The Commission also notes that English football fans who last season wished to watch more than the 88 live matches offered by BSkyB in its basic sports package also had to sign up for a second subscription channel from BSkyB, Prem Plus.
live	live_vrb	But it seems that these Inuits live in sumptuous houses on the west coast or the east coast, or in Amsterdam, or in Paris, or in Tel Aviv. One of the miracles of leg-traps is that the whole planet is inhabited by Inuits.
live	live_vrb	Nonetheless, Belgium, in tandem with other Member States, has taken on a pioneering role in this discussion and the question is then, will that country, with its businesses and people who work and live there, suffer as a result?
live	None	This attack was the third such attack in recent weeks. Vicious nailbombs were deliberately planted in crowded areas frequented and populated by London's minority communities, people who can normally live quite contentedly and happily within the vibrant, mixed, multicultural city that is London.
live	None	They have all chosen flight in the hope that wherever they may one day find refuge, they really will be able to find better and more secure futures, and above all live safer lives.
live	live_vrb	Is the Council satisfied that the Chinese authorities are making sufficient efforts to live up to the principles of the Olympic Charter?
live	None	As long as we do not know that for certain, we do not need to worry about the limitation of scope, for it is of course the case that small and medium-sized enterprises live from markets that are as transparent as possible and that they find easiest to access, and if the WTO member states reduce the scope by a quarter, I do not know whether small and medium-sized businesses actually derive any benefit from that.
live	lives_vrb	Notwithstanding the geographical area of application of the agreement, Article 13 provides that the Parties may agree to extend cooperation on the management of anadromous and catadromous species, but excludes species which live their entire life cycle in internal waters.
live	live_vrb	Furthermore, of the bovine animals, it is the bull that has the best life; since we are talking about animal welfare, it should be pointed out that bulls are very well fed, they live in the open air, they run around in the way that animals like to do, and in the end they die fighting using their own defences.
live	live_vrb	They live in the internment camp of Mitrovica in inhuman circumstances, their health is endangered by poisonous water in the wells, and the local authorities do not take appropriate measures to eliminate the problem.
live	live_vrb	In actual fact, I asked to be given the floor just to remind people that animals that live almost unobserved in the wild have better lives than animals kept in cages.
live	live_vrb	We are prepared to disseminate good projects which can provide employment and learning opportunities where young people live; but there are also many examples which provide opportunities to go and work in other countries.
live	live_vrb	The majority of prostitutes live miserable lives, exposed to the risks of, for example, assault, rape and sexually transmitted diseases.
live	live_vrb	Ladies and gentlemen, the world we live in does not belong to us.
live	live_vrb	Those concerns are many and varied, but to my mind they hinge around responses to the challenges of the world in which we live.
live	live_vrb	The issue is to ensure that these regions remain worthwhile places to live – attractive and active – thus creating a viable world in which people can live and work.
live	live_vrb	The Treaty specifies in particular that the Community should seek to eliminate differences in the level of development of different regions. The relevant provisions seek to ensure that people can live and earn a living even in the remotest regions of the Union.
live	live_vrb	What they cannot do is want to force us to live according to the rules of that fantasy world.
live	live_vrb	I am able to tell you, on behalf of the Council, that I am committed to constructive cooperation with Parliament and to working tirelessly to ensure that our people can live in security and freedom.
live	live_vrb	There is still, alas, insufficient willingness in Kosovo to accept that this European Union of ours has committed itself to a multi-ethnic Kosovo inhabited mainly by the Albanian population, but in which the Serbs must also be able to live in freedom and peace and go about their normal work and economic activity.
live	live_vrb	We Social Democrats believe that it is important for everyone to be guaranteed a decent wage that it is possible to live on, and we think that the EU should encourage this.
live	live_vrb	When we talk of totalitarianism, we do so not because we want to live in the past.
lives	lives_vrb	The big threat for the future is the old familiar one which people have lived with for millions of years and which the developing world still lives with.
lives	lives_nou	Some have fled in fear of their lives, and we should be able to offer them sanctuary and give them every opportunity to put their claim for asylum.
lives	lives_nou	Less innovation will result in us and our children being exposed to more dangerous substances in our daily lives.
lives	lives_nou	Many people laid down their lives in defence of Solidarity.
lives	lives_nou	In view of the countless number of infringement proceedings brought by the Directorate-General for the Internal Market in the field of health care and of the unsatisfactory legal situation in which the user-citizens find themselves, we need, for consistency's sake, to lay down a directive on health services that spells out the common values and the principles applicable to health care systems in the Union, and this, so that the citizens regain confidence in Europe in one area of their everyday lives - health care - for their health is their most precious asset.
lives	lives_nou	Furthermore, although the number of States Parties to the Convention has considerably increased, and the number of victims of anti-personnel landmines is going down, there is still a need to assist victims and to improve their lives in practice.
lives	lives_nou	That affects their lives and the lives of their families and it has a very significant medical, social and economic cost.
lives	lives_nou	All this is being done in the name of protecting us from terrorism; but what is actually happening, of course, is the never-ending mission of the European Union to increase and entrench its own power and dominion in every area of our national lives.
lives	lives_nou	Yet while people's emotions are being ruled by fear, death is final, and no one can bring back the hundreds of people whose lives have been sacrificed to Israel's security needs since the Gaza Strip was sealed off.
lives	lives_nou	We needed to give the citizens of those countries a strong signal of support for their efforts at reform and their ambitions for better lives.
lives	lives_nou	People must know how to use computers for beneficial and essential purposes so they can improve their own way of working and take better control of their lives.
lives	lives_nou	We must not forget that, while some celebrate independence, Georgia is mourning the innocent people who lost their lives and homes when the Russian troops invaded.
lives	lives_nou	It is important for us to accept that there are moments of crisis, sorrow and strain in all of our lives and that when we experience them we may need support and we may need understanding, but we do not always need a diagnosis and a drug.
lives	lives_nou	Even though adoption is an effective way of ensuring that children do not spend their lives in orphanages, it is essential that strict inspections are carried out, in particular, of international organisations, in order to prevent abuse.
lives	lives_nou	The reality that we are looking at here today is that the crisis we now face in the current economic turmoil presents us with an opportunity to correct the wrongs of the past and to ensure that we now invest in research and innovation and use that money to find new ways of dealing with problems and finding solutions to the problems that people face in their lives, as well as ensuring that we give hope to people.
lives	lives_nou	The tragedy reigning in the North Caucasus has only deepened in recent years with pervasive human rights violations still affecting the daily lives of the communities in Chechnya, in Ossetia, Dagestan, North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.
lives	lives_nou	To be frank, I find it incredible that these two Members can say what they said, knowing that this costs the lives of half a million women each year.
lives	lives_nou	Moreover, even if it is important for many authorities to collect revenue for the information it produces when it is being used for commercial purposes, it is important that our citizens can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own lives and health without having to pay for it.
lives	lives_nou	Money is earned from the production and sale of tobacco, but it shortens the lives of many people and makes them less healthy.
lives	lives_nou	And therefore we cannot but be divided into two categories: those who are in good faith and those who are in bad faith, with those who fight for principles realising that force sometimes needs to be used to defend them, since force or war are not good or evil in themselves but necessary attitudes and decisions when it comes to fighting for human lives and dignity.
lives	lives_nou	There are appalling violations of international law and human rights constantly taking place in the Palestinian territories at the moment, and the international community must stop this, as it must stop the madness of terrorism which is leading young people to sacrifice their young lives for a cause which, far from benefiting their own people, makes more innocent people victims and gives the leader of the Israeli Government the excuse to declare unilaterally outright war on the Palestinian Authority, its structure and members, starting with President Arafat.
lives	lives_nou	Mr President, there are still many people, some of which are in this House if this debate is anything to go by, who would like to give preferential treatment to marriage and family and, as such, openly insult and discriminate against anyone making a different choice in their private lives.
lives	lives_nou	The second is the car park beneath us - Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex - Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs - all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading.
lives	lives_nou	Some studies on gender-based violence estimate that between a fifth and a quarter of Europe's female population have been victims of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and around one tenth of them have suffered sexual violence.
lives	lives_nou	There is the case of two Ukrainian doctors who risked their lives to expose local Ukrainian businesses that market organ tissue from 20-week-old babies, purchased, birthed and kept alive during the painful harvesting process.
lives	lives_nou	We must bring this idea to life by going even further and proposing that throughout their lives people should alternate between working and training by moving from one to the other without any unwanted breaks, that is, without any periods of unemployment.
lives	lives_nou	As for the reports under discussion, I would note that there is a strong link between growing insecurity at work and in the lives of young women, even though they are better educated and more skilled, the inadequate protection of atypical female workers - which most young women are - during maternity and parenthood, the shortcomings of current policies for achieving balance and the lower rates of female employment, the more frequent instances of poverty among women and children, and the lower level of their pensions and, hence, their exclusion from decision-making powers.
lives	lives_nou	While in the past, European conflicts had global implications, today European cooperation is improving lives and is a source of admiration across the world.
lives	lives_nou	Whatever action we take will determine not only the lives of the people affected, but also the moral standing and the capacity of the EU to lead in the world.
lives	lives_nou	Given the increasing need for organ transplants, the growing transplant waiting lists and the consequent rise in the number of deaths due to a shortage of donated organs, promoting best transplantation policies in the EU is vital for saving more lives and offering European citizens a better quality of life.
lives	lives_nou	Drugs breed crime and social destitution and tear many people' s lives apart.
lives	lives_vrb	In order to feed a population which lives on the best land in the world, Russia must therefore import massive amounts of foodstuffs, which we produce, but for which it is now virtually unable to pay.
lives	lives_vrb	Mr President, noise pollution around airports is always an emotive subject for the citizens who live near them, and Mr Jarzembowski who lives in Hamburg, knows this all too well.
minute	minute	.   Mr President, it is hard to know what to say about women’s issues within the one minute of speaking time available to me in this debate.
minute	minute	The draftsmen of opinions had two minutes' speaking time and they exceeded that time by 40 seconds or a minute, or even a minute and a half, in the case of the last draftsman.
minute	minute	Mr Nattrass, for your information, your group may speak today for five minutes, divided up as follows: one minute for Mrs Krupa, one minute for Mr Bloom, a further one and a half minutes for Mrs Krupa and one and a half minutes for yourself, and not two and a half minutes.
minute	minute	Secondly, we took into account all the Commission's last-minute amendments, because the Commission - which is the only body and institution that can initiate legislation - submitted its proposal, but the terms of the waiver request submitted to the WTO are not the same as the proposal that the Commission tabled before Parliament.
minute	minute	Every minute, ten people are infected with HIV.
minute	minute	That concludes the one-minute speeches.
minute	minute	However, the will to collaborate has not been able to prevent last minute problems, because during the conciliation for the second reading, Parliament was confronted by Council requests for even greater efforts, demanding cuts in appropriations in those very headings 3 and 4, in exchange for an equivalent reduction in heading 1 appropriations.
minute	minute	Every minute, some 100 pregnancies are terminated, 40 of them unsafely carried out by persons with no medical training.
minute	minute	(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
minute	minute	Colleagues, I interrupt the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance in order to make an announcement.
minute	minute	(EL) Mr President, with all due respect to you, I hereby request that you provide us tomorrow with a list of all those who asked to speak for one minute based on two criteria: firstly, that they did not speak during the previous plenary and, secondly, the time at which they filed their request.
minute	minute	I allowed them to speak for at least 15 seconds and even a minute in some cases, and the balance between the political groups has been fully respected.
minute	minute	The first item we are going to deal with is the requests for one-minute speeches from Members.
minute	minute	Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in today’s world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute, but this would also mean giving up the competition, and would result in falling irrecoverably behind.
minute	minute	Mr President, I believe that brings me to the end of what I wanted to say and, as you can see, I still have a minute left to speak.
minute	minute	One minute is the maximum amount of time I am normally allowed in Parliament to express myself in my own language.
minute	minute	Do not expect from me in a reply of one minute to give a decisive answer to such an important issue as the one you have put forward.
minute	minute	One-minute speeches (Rule 150)
minute	minute	You will have the opportunity to express your views on this during the one-minute questions.
minute	minute	Mr President, this report has been the subject of negotiations right up to the last minute, and I should therefore be grateful if you would take account of this proposal for an oral amendment which, in the form in which I shall read it to you, should perhaps facilitate the adoption of the report at first reading.
minute	minute	Supplementary questions using the blue card are not permitted during the one-minute speeches.
minute	minute	(SV) Mr President, as I only have one minute, I will just mention one point.
minute	minute	I now invite Mr Wynn to speak for one minute.
minute	minute	I approached the 25 Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the Union with a view to expressing this feeling in the most solemn and collective manner possible. I suggested all schools across the Union should join us, the representatives of the citizens of Europe, in a minute’s silence today in memory of the child victims of the Beslan school killings and more generally, in memory of all other child victims of terrorism.
minute	minute	The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
minute	minute	If we can improve it, let us do so, but let us not call into question the level of the project by making last-minute demands that would change the balance already struck.
minute	minute	Civil and democratic Europe must show its sorrow and, for this reason, Mr President, I ask you to invite the House to observe a minute's silence in memory of the victims of immigration.
minute	minute	Mr President, can I ask you for a two-minute break while people are leaving the Chamber?
minute	minute	In normal, run-of-the-mill circumstances when we have the budget debate, we have already voted on first readings in committee, we come to the Chamber and most of us make a three-minute speech if we are lucky or, if not, a one and a half minute speech.
minute	minute	I suggest that we take a five-minute break in order for the High Representative and everybody else who has been in the Chamber, and will continue in the Chamber, to catch their breath, and that we resume at 17.35: five minutes from now.
minute	minute	As I understand it, in Amsterdam Germany's Chancellor Kohl right at the last minute rejected attempts to ease the decision-making process on the question of environmental taxation.
minute	minute	We shall minute your point of order, Mr Posselt, and we shall provide you with an answer in the appropriate manner.
misuse	misuse_nou	I have voted in favour of the Auken Report, since it clearly criticises the reckless town planning by the Spanish state, and highlights the misuse of Community funds in planning and environment matters.
misuse	misuse_nou	It is only right that the Council clamped down on this type of misuse of Community funding by amending the flax regulation.
misuse	misuse_nou	The question arises as to whether the current plan to block child pornography on the Internet would comply with the Convention, especially as Internet blocks by the entertainment industry are used as an opportunity to install copyright filters, and the majority of the sites originate in the US and therefore are not subject to EU law, so the root of the problem of misuse is not tackled.
misuse	misuse_nou	(DE) Mr President, I would like to ask Mrs Vaidere: now that we have put down in black and white all the points concerning our consternation in relation to the misuse of power and the repression in Ukraine, what objection can there be to taking this text to Kiev in a fortnight's time in order to discuss it and then to decide how we proceed from there?
misuse	misuse_nou	The same goes for the proposal concerning trademarks and brands and for Article 4(3) on nutrition claims about alcohol, linked to the provision that health claims supporting national authority or Community messages about the dangers of the misuse of alcohol should not fall within the scope of the regulation.
misuse	misuse_nou	Mr President, the large-scale misuse of asylum is a very serious problem in the European Union, and it would therefore be misplaced to discuss ad infinitum the gender of angels.
misuse	misuse_nou	I think we have to discuss this right from the start in relation to the general accessibility of cultural goods, protection against misuse and forming part of a regional or local cultural context.
misuse	misuse_nou	Consumer organisations welcome the implementation of the trustmark and are committed to revealing and disclosing any misuse, with the help of existing technical and legal resources.
misuse	misuse_nou	Finally, it calls for the political courage to monitor the budget and fight against its misuse.
misuse	misuse_vrb	The Flemish Government has always refused to sign this agreement - with good reason - since French-speaking Belgians who have moved to Flanders want to misuse it in order to have French recognised as an official language in Flanders. This is in conflict with language legislation that has been established with great difficulty and the principle of territoriality in Belgium.
misuse	misuse_vrb	It is encouraging that the cause of the environment is gaining ground in all the EU institutions, but we must take care not to misuse this good cause by introducing unnecessary or bureaucratic rules without appreciating the possible consequences.
misuse	misuse_vrb	It is an invitation to misuse a well-meaning law.
misuse	misuse_vrb	This is not the first time that the left-wing groups in this House have sought to misuse the human rights report in order to make abortion more freely available.
misuse	None	The absence of democracy, transparency and accountability, corruption at all levels and misuse of the flow of assistance provided by the international community are all part of the problem.
misuse	None	Until today, I had never read, in one publication, such a devastating set of facts on the misuse of public funds by the European institutions, some of which are worth highlighting.
misuse	None	However, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs García Pérez, that a uniform approach is needed in all the Member States in order to avoid increasing disparities within the European Union and misuse of European taxpayers' money.
misuse	None	Limiting the scope of the directive so that it includes serious crimes, protection of data security, access to data and the recourse to criminal sanctions for misuse of data – these are real achievements!
misuse	None	I endorse wholeheartedly the decision of the European summit to give its support to Yasser Arafat as the leader of the Palestinian people and I condemn without reservation the misuse of the Security Council veto in blocking the appointment of international observers to the Middle East conflict.
misuse	None	I cannot but ask what the European bodies and institutions intend to do in cases of misuse of these symbols?
misuse	None	In view of the diversity - and also the positive changes - in judicial legislation, and out of concern for certain rights which are still being denied, for example the misuse of preventive detention and prison overcrowding in some countries, this report was intended to home in on some of the approaches already being followed in certain countries, bringing them to the attention of the others.
misuse	None	I do not know whether or not this was an oversight, but may I point out that our committee's Amendment No 40, which relates to Article 5, paragraph 2, stating that Member States shall take appropriate measures with a view to preventing misuse, is deleted under Amendment No 86.
misuse	None	The report places the emphasis on compliance with the non-proliferation treaty, but overlooks the colossal security risk posed by poorly guarded or semi-abandoned nuclear facilities in former Soviet states and a number of other countries, and the misuse that can be made of them by terror organisations such as Al-Qaida.
misuse	None	The list of authorities granted access will thus be published in the Official Journal, and this will help to prevent any misuse of the data by making it possible to identify by whom, when and why the data from the system were exploited.
misuse	None	If there are no dramatic improvements in the financial administration, European taxpayers will know how to react against this irresponsible misuse of their money.
misuse	None	It is intolerable that countries such as China should misuse raw materials as a political tool.
misuse	None	Much also depends on the contribution of, and efforts made by, Member States to cut back their errors and to avoid the misuse of money.
misuse	None	I want to condemn the attempts to misuse specific moments of difficulty and present them as a bad attitude on the part of the government in principle, and, above all, doing so in the European Parliament.
mobile	mobile	You will be aware - because I noticed a distinctly presidential frown - that a Member' s mobile phone went off during the speech of, I think it was, the Prime Minister of Finland.
mobile	mobile	It has, however, proved possible to draw up this new standard for the third generation of mobile communications within a relatively short period of time and with the broad consensus of all the parties involved.
mobile	mobile	The only option for consumers is to choose not to communicate by mobile phone.
mobile	mobile	We must aim to do what is best for Europe: free up the spectrum for new services and increased mobile traffic, open up new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services in the framework of broadband and, at the same time, secure the same opportunities for broadcasters as they enjoy today.
mobile	mobile	Examples would be the positive experience that was gained from the common standardisation of second generation mobile phone systems and which is directly visible now in the strengthened competitive position with regard to third generation output.
mobile	mobile	Scientific studies have shown that these radiations generate health problems, such as sleep disorder, child leukaemia, significant increase in stress and the use of a mobile phone for ten years doubles the risk of brain cancer.
mobile	mobile	In the meantime, restrictions on freedom of assembly, association and expression, including those on the Internet and mobile phones, need to end. Until then, restrictive measures provided for in the EU decision will have to be enforced.
mobile	mobile	In a world in which capital is becoming increasingly mobile, Europe’s most precious competitive advantage remains its well-educated and trained labour force, which also has the independence necessary to enable it to react to constant change.
mobile	mobile	The public is concerned not only about fixed installations such as electricity transmission lines, television transmitters and mobile phone antennas, but also about the fact that we are continually in contact with domestic appliances and other devices which emit electromagnetic fields; the best-known one at present is perhaps the mobile phone, currently the subject of much debate.
mobile	mobile	As far as mobile air conditioning is concerned, it is disappointing that the committee has failed to take note of those parts of European industry that are already committed to delivering CO2 mobile air conditioning as soon as possible.
mobile	mobile	in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on the proposal relating to the Regulation of the European Parliament and Council concerning roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC on the common regulatory framework for electronic communications.
mobile	mobile	The number of mobile subscribers is anticipated to grow at a greater rate than in 2002, despite the high penetration rates already achieved.
mobile	mobile	Experience and qualifications should receive equivalent recognition throughout Europe, and social security and pension systems should be able to be transferred from one country to another without prejudice to the mobile student or worker.
mobile	mobile	In a more global and mobile world, transparency regarding the performance of higher education institutions can stimulate both competition and cooperation, and be an incentive for further improvements and modernisation.
mobile	mobile	I was rapporteur on the Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) Directive relating to their use in mobile air conditioning.
mobile	mobile	I think the best thing would have been for Parliament to decide to abolish completely all roaming charges and declare that all mobile rates within the European Union shall be identical.
mobile	mobile	The same is true of mobile telephony.
mobile	mobile	Since 1980, the burden of tax has been shifting from mobile factors such as capital to the least mobile factor of labour.
mobile	mobile	The riches of the country are being plundered by friend and foe alike. For example, the coltran that we use in our mobile phones and military equipment is being mined and exploited by the Rwandans in the Kivu, to their own advantage.
mobile	mobile	This is going to continue with the next set of mobile-phone licences known as UMTS licences when the respective EU governments give them out.
mobile	mobile	That is why it is also necessary, in particular where worker participation is concerned, for us to keep a sense of proportion and not to burden the companies adopting this model with these new rights in such a way that it is simply no longer of interest to those who wish either to enter Europe or to use the European Company to be more mobile within the European single market.
mobile	mobile	. I voted against the resolution on working conditions of mobile workers assigned to interoperable cross-border services.
mobile	mobile	in writing. - (SV) The report on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services is about how we are to provide a common European system of satellite services, an important factor in strengthening the continued competitiveness of Europe in advanced technological research and industry.
mobile	mobile	In particular, young people who do not or cannot become mobile through programmes such as Erasmus, Comenius or Leonardo within the context of formal education need a change to gain useful experience of intercultural dialogue, and there needs to be more recognition of the role and importance of informal education in this respect.
mobile	mobile	What I am pleased to see with this proposal is that we are finally moving in the direction when the days when we can throw fridges, televisions, toasters, mobile phones and other electrical goods into a landfill are over.
mobile	mobile	Today it is a matter of removing legislative obstacles to the future development of mobile satellite services for emergency communications, for saving the lives, health and property of half a billion citizens.
mobile	mobile	There is the deception of consumers who, having used a mobile telephone such as this one, which their contract told them included international calls, have a shock when they discover the cost of their bills. To give an example, this is what happened to me only recently when, having used an Internet connection two or three times in Italy one day, I received a bill from the virtually nationalised French operator Orange for EUR 1 200, and for another day spent on the very edge of the French border, between Evian and Geneva, I received one for EUR 3 000!
mobile	mobile	But it is at a time like this that you realise how mobile animals are.
ornament	ornament_nou	As the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, said in this Chamber during the last part-session, the Constitution is not a caprice, a whim or mere ornament.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	The workers will fight to overthrow this stable structure.
overthrow	None	In any case, they will not achieve one of their aims, which is to overthrow the constitutional monarchy.
overthrow	overthrow_nou	Following the overthrow of the USSR and the promotion and support, direct or indirect, of the so-called Russian Mafia, which controls a large section of the economic and therefore the social life of the country, plans are being pushed through to strengthen the process of democratization, which aims to completely marginalize the Russian people and to subject them to the geopolitical dictates of NATO and the USA.
overthrow	overthrow_nou	However, the people of Europe are gradually overcoming their torpor following the overthrow of socialism in Europe and are preparing for a counter-attack.
overthrow	overthrow_nou	It is right and proper now to recognise the new Otunbayeva government, an unusual example where we have a common interest with that of Russia, which actually supported the revolution and overthrow of the Bakiyev regime.
overthrow	overthrow_nou	(DE) Mr President, the overthrow of the Tunisian Government has caused shock waves in neighbouring countries in the Maghreb region, which are mainly dictatorships, and also in Libya.
overthrow	overthrow_nou	Is the world today safer than before the overthrow of the appalling Saddam?
overthrow	overthrow_nou	This is because the situation of considerable uncertainty and poverty formed fertile ground, favourable to the spread of demonstrations and to the overthrow of the government of Mr Akaev, who had been making himself rich off the Kyrgyz economy since 1991.
overthrow	overthrow_nou	There has been no functioning government since the overthrow of the Said Barre regime in 1991 which led to anarchy, inter-clan fighting and banditry.
overthrow	None	The people are behind elected President Chavez, whose election has been confirmed at least five times and who is taking decisive action against the attempt organised both by major economic interests and, as we all know, the United States, to overthrow him.
overthrow	None	(PL) When asked whether it was worth risking nuclear war to overthrow capitalism, Mao Zedong said it was worth sacrificing even a hundred million lives so that the rest of humanity could live happily under communism.
overthrow	None	It seems that the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was only an initial stage in this battle, which must be conducted first and foremost within our own States.
overthrow	None	Even though the prosecution demanded the death penalty, the opposition leaders were, in the very end, sentenced to imprisonment of between six and twenty years for allegedly having plotted to overthrow President Obiang.
overthrow	None	Many of these medics have been accused of trying to overthrow the monarchy and face trial with military prosecutors and possible death sentences.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	With other partners, the European Union has condemned the recent attempt by the rebels to overthrow President Kabbah's legitimately elected government for the second time in two years.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	There is no agenda on the part of the international community to undermine Sudanese sovereignty or, worse still, to overthrow the Sudanese regime.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	Following the failed coup d'etat in Venezuela, attempts by the economic and political establishment of the country, together with its international allies (USA etc.) to overthrow President Chavez are intensifying.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	By cutting off the European market, we can demonstrate our determined intention to overthrow Lukashenko's regime.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	Clinton cannot forgive the Iraqi government for having thwarted the plot hatched by the CIA to overthrow it and demonstrated that the great majority of the four million Iraqi Kurds would prefer, together with Mr Barzani's party, to remain within their national borders.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	We should support his partisans in the Northern Alliance, the sole representatives of the recognised government in Afghanistan, and help them in any way we can to overthrow the barbarous Taliban regime.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	They are demanding measures to satisfy modern grassroots requirements which can only be met by a united front of the working classes, the poor and middle classes in the towns and countryside, to confront and overthrow the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	Welcomes the imperialist maritime supervision of Somalia by the naval forces of the EU and calls for the EU to set up a Sudanese 'state policing and regular army mechanism' abroad, which must not overthrow the country's government.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	What initiatives will the Council take to thwart the attempt by the external forces supporting the Venezuelan economic oligarchy to overthrow the legally elected President Chavez with the aim of controlling the 5th most important oil-producing country, and to ensure that the verdict of the Venezuelan people is respected at international level?
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	Implicating solely Slobodan Milosevic and his entourage insinuates that it would be enough to overthrow them in order for everything to be put right, for the Kosovar Albanians to return to their homes and for everyone to live in harmony in a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	It is neither the habit nor the task of Europe to overthrow regimes, and clearly we shall not be voting for the Nicholson report until there is no longer any doubt on this point.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	By the way, most of the media outlets in Venezuela are in private ownership, actually, including powerful media corporations which conspired to overthrow Hugo Chávez in 2002, who happens to have been elected and re-elected many times by the people of Venezuela.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	The latter is engaged in a struggle to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, and its aim is to establish a Communist state.
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	Just who do you think you are to overthrow these democratic measures laid down for us but open for all to follow?
overthrow	overthrow_vrb	The European Parliament and the European Union must take up a very firm and decisive position on Belarus, so that we can finally overthrow the last bloody dictatorship in Europe.

pasty	None	In any event, Mr Pasty, let me thank you for your observations.
pasty	None	I also wish to raise a point of order, in connection with the same points mentioned by previous speakers, Mr Pasty and Mr Striby in particular.
pasty	None	The Dutch presidency recently received questions on this from Mr Donnay and Mr Pasty, but it has not responded.
pasty	None	Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, and also Mr Pasty to some extent, gave a wrong interpretation of the Court of Auditors' report on DAS.
pasty	None	I personally watched Mr Pasty put a card in seat 493 behind him one minute ago.
pasty	None	As Jean-Claude Pasty said only the other day, Parliament would also be contravening the financial rules of our institution.
pasty	None	The last point I would make in summing up the challenge for the UK presidency and echoing the points made by Mr Pasty and others, is that institutional reform cannot stand still and I believe that it will be a great fillip if during the Cardiff Summit we are able to come up with a common statute so that Members of this House are not discriminated against by nationality.
pasty	None	The bells rang yesterday, but as Mr Pasty quite rightly said, there was no other indication whatsoever what was going on in the Chamber.
pasty	None	Madam President, I agree with what Mrs Fontaine and Mr Pasty have said but I should like to broaden the matter rather than narrow it down.
pasty	None	Are there any objections to Mr Pasty's proposal?
pasty	None	Mr Pasty has the floor on a point of order.
pasty	None	I refer to the letter from Mr Pasty to President Hänsch which was read out yesterday by the President.

pasty	None	Are you asking for the quorum to be established, Mr Pasty?
pasty	None	As permitted by the Rules, Mr Pasty has asked for the floor to make a personal statement.
perfect	perfect_vrb	In short, by making this contribution, the European Parliament is fulfilling its function of directly representing the concerns and wishes entrusted to it, and is trying to perfect this proposal, which was already good, on this crucial subject.
perfect	perfect_adj	It is a perfect example of the 25% of regulations referred to by Mr Barroso.
perfect	None	The common position may be less than perfect, but I feel that it does offer sufficient safeguards.
perfect	perfect_adj	It actually makes perfect sense to attach development aid to the – indirect – financing of developing regional economies, in which case we will be helping to ensure that the aid granted is doubly effective.
perfect	perfect_vrb	What is at stake is research and innovation in the European Union, where industrial companies make enormous efforts to perfect original designs after a complex process.
perfect	perfect_adj	The result is certainly not perfect, and it certainly does not please everyone.
perfect	perfect_adj	As we all know, nobody is perfect in this world, but it is in accordance with Europe's political standards and norms, and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy, that we expect the Ukrainian authorities not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials, and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial, rather than political retribution.
perfect	perfect_adj	No country has a perfect record when it comes to enforcing environmental legislation.
perfect	perfect_adj	What I am saying does not mean that everything is perfect.
perfect	perfect_adj	An agreement is never perfect, of course; it is the fruit of compromise.
perfect	perfect_adj	The European Arrest Warrant was trumpeted as the perfect example of mutual recognition in the area of justice and policing.
perfect	perfect_adj	It is not perfect for anybody, but it does not damage anybody's interests, and therefore constitutes a promising starting point.
perfect	perfect_adj	If Mr Gasòliba i Böhm says here that we would or could not implement here a theoretically perfect model then he is of course right but the introduction of the euro simply sets conditions and requirements which a model of economic policy must meet and this is not achieved following present discussions on Mr Gasòliba i Böhm's proposals.
perfect	perfect_adj	It is a perfect example of one of the benefits of enlargement – of our welcoming ten new Member States – that we have representatives with such strength and wisdom to improve the quality of our discussions.
perfect	perfect_adj	Of course, the regulation may not be perfect, but it is very good.
perfect	perfect_adj	This does not mean that we think this regulation is now perfect.
perfect	perfect_adj	While this is not perfect, it is a step in the right direction.
perfect	perfect_adj	The project is not perfect, but it seems that the Human Rights Council’s duty of carrying out an assessment of the situation in each of its member states will at least prevent the abuses that have hitherto been perpetrated by its own members.
perfect	perfect_adj	The perfect example is the Globalisation Fund: a little poke of financial sweeties.
perfect	perfect_adj	It need not be perfect, but a dialogue is necessary to make any improvements.
perfect	perfect_adj	In particular, the success of my own country under the cohesion policy since we joined the European Union is a perfect example.
perfect	perfect_adj	It is not perfect, and it is certainly not as succinct as I would like but, given all the circumstances, I endorse it as a good result.
perfect	perfect_adj	What a perfect example of the Commission's double standards!
perfect	perfect_adj	Firstly, I would like to congratulate both Commissioner Piebalgs and Mr La Russa, the rapporteur, on taking a significant step in the liberalisation of the gas market, although it is certainly not perfect.
perfect	perfect_adj	The directive is not, of course, perfect.
perfect	perfect_adj	As for good intentions, the proposal for a Council regulation which is before us today is a perfect illustration of such intentions.
perfect	perfect_adj	The rail system is a perfect illustration of this.
perfect	perfect_adj	We must come to a rapid decision so that we can finally offer the users on this market a legal framework, even if, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, it may not be perfect in every way and may still have a number of weaknesses.
perfect	perfect_adj	That situation would not, of course, be perfect and there would be obstacles to circumvent.
perfect	perfect_adj	No Constitution is perfect, but no Constitution can be improved unless it enters into force.
perfect	perfect_adj	You have to face up to it: the enterprise aimed at introducing pure and perfect supranationality, launched eight years ago by the great Giscard convention, has well and truly been aborted.
perfect	perfect_adj	It is the perfect response to the various issues now affecting our fellow citizens in the form of new information and communication technologies.
perfect	perfect_adj	This episode is a perfect illustration of the cavalier way in which this Parliament too often goes about its business, and that is no laughing matter given the profound effect the EU has on people’s daily lives.
perfect	perfect_adj	By way of example, the three laws in force in the Czech Republic on the matter are far from perfect.
perfect	perfect_adj	In this setting, the recently-held presidential elections were not perfect, but in the words of the international observation mission, were 'administered mostly in line with OSCE and Council of Europe [...] standards'.
perfect	perfect_adj	Perhaps, Mr Schnellhardt, you are right that it wasn' t totally practical, it wasn' t perfect, it wasn' t quite right.
perfect	perfect_adj	And as President Prodi has already said, it makes perfect sense for the accession treaties to be ratified in the individual Member States in accordance with their respective legal systems.
perfume	perfume_nou	I owe my hair colour to l'Oréal, my perfume is by Dior, and my face cream comes from Great Britain - Englishwomen have such wonderful complexions.
perfume	perfume_nou	No-one can deny, after all, that culture is an active element of European citizenship, strengthening the feeling of belonging to the European Union and one which unites us all in the respect of the same values; therefore we have to grant cultural policies the funding they deserve - otherwise culture is just like perfume or a flower of rhetoric.
perfume	perfume_nou	For how long will the toothpaste still taste good and for how long will the perfume or the skin cream remain safe to use and not turn rancid?
perfume	perfume_nou	What I find most absurd is that I can fly into Europe with duty-free liquids - alcohol, perfume or food bought outside of the EU - but should I transit to another plane within the EU, it will be confiscated by the authorities.
perfume	perfume_nou	Taking counterfeit medication is certainly not the same thing as using a fake perfume.
perfume	perfume_nou	Since there is lung disease in my family, I can point out that, for example, the use of perfume constitutes at least as serious a problem for someone with an allergy.
perfume	perfume_nou	As far as Amendment No 21 on fragrance listing is concerned, this amendment requires a full ingredient listing, including perfume composition.
perfume	perfume_nou	It would cost 13 billion dollars - the amount spent every year on perfume in the USA - to provide food and health care for the world's most needy.
perfume	perfume_nou	We have about US$1 billion worth of products involved here, including jewellery and perfume as well as fish products.
perfume	perfume_nou	Mr Berenguer Fuster and the rapporteur have referred to alleged price increases in Germany of films, perfume and cameras.
perfume	perfume_nou	Normally I do not take much notice of the lobbying information I get in this Parliament, in particular from industry, but I was amazed at 'Cosmetics - your choice, our responsibility' from the European Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfume Association.
pervert	pervert_vrb	However, within the report, paragraphs 2 and 4 pervert and distort the real aims of cohesion and everything else which has been promised.
pervert	pervert_vrb	The issue of whether drug abusers should face criminal charges is a matter for Member State law and the EU should not be seeking to pervert the course of justice.
pervert	pervert_vrb	Nor is it legitimate to pervert parliamentary procedures in the way that this motion of censure does, to use sophistry and insinuation and impugn people’s motives without any evidence.
pervert	pervert_vrb	The attempt to pervert history is an attempt to poison the conscience of younger generations, so that they accept the crimes of imperialism today, and to stop them fighting to overturn them.
pervert	pervert_vrb	We pervert it when we demand equality for its very antithesis.
pervert	pervert_vrb	For its part, the institutional architecture of the African Union includes provisions intended to ensure that the nature and democratic operation of national governments are equipped to deal with any attacks and attempts to pervert them, so that joint African action is in line with rules which no one is allowed to infringe.
pervert	pervert_vrb	.– The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the resolution on the ratification procedures of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the communication strategy because its basic aim is to mislead the people of the Member States and to pervert the history of Europe.
pervert	pervert_vrb	To justify it in those terms is to pervert Islam.
polish	polish	To polish up his international image he has, to his credit I suppose, compensated grieving families, but in truth, the maverick Gaddafi would be totally ostracised by the West were it not for Libya's prodigious reserves of oil and gas.
polish	polish_geo	The rules governing the driving of vehicles, as laid down in the Polish Road Traffic Act of 20 June 1997 (Official Journal No 108, 2005, Item 908, as amended), set the permissible blood alcohol level at 0.2 mg/l. Driving with a blood-alcohol level of more than 0.5 mg/l is a criminal offence subject to imprisonment for up to two years.

polish	polish_geo	The Polish PSE delegation have made every effort to ensure that the definition of vodka remains in line with Polish interests and have called for traditional recipes and regional methods be respected in the production of spirit drinks.
postulate	postulate_vrb	We need loyalty, and that is why we postulate that inter-State applications should not be brought concerning an alleged failure of compliance when the act falls within the scope of Union law.
postulate	None	We postulate this and we should do our utmost to put it into law.
postulate	postulate_vrb	If you want us to achieve the things that you yourself postulate, then give us the powers, give us the money, and do not stand in Europe’s way as it moves towards political union, or in the way of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
postulate	postulate_nou	Neither the status quo nor the postulate of deeper integration bringing indisputable benefits can or should be regarded as sacrosanct by any European democrat.
postulate	postulate_nou	This report is based on the following postulate: culture and the economy have today become inseparable.
postulate	postulate_vrb	Drawing attention to the influence of advertising is all well and good, but it would be better to postulate ethical-legal control based on prior acceptance of a universal value system, founded, best of all, on divine law.
postulate	postulate_vrb	Nevertheless, irrespective of the importance of efficient law enforcement in this area, we must not depart from the principle of criminal-law liability and postulate strict liability. The report is therefore on the right track.
postulate	postulate_vrb	Although the report does not postulate the creation of a common customs service, the Commission notes that it strongly recommends the establishment of a European framework that will, as the rapporteur said, enable the 15 national customs services to act as one.
present	None	As the author is not present, Question No 2 lapses.
present	present_adj-nou	Mr President, our group welcomes the fact that the Commission has endorsed the proposal made by the Council during the negotiation of the price package: a setaside rate limited to 5 % and the abolition of the extraordinary setaside, the retention of which would have been particularly absurd when cereal stocks are as unusually low as they are at present.
present	present_adj-nou	That is not easy, but the present system is untenable.
present	present_adj-nou	In conclusion, the Irish presidency has laid a firm foundation for the succeeding presidencies on the IGC, on EMU and shown that sensitive diplomacy which recognizes what Europe can do and the role it can play in the present world is something we have to offer.
present	present_adj-nou	You will recall that when submitting its proposal for a supplement to the research framework programme the Commission indicated in its explanatory memorandum that a substantial increase in the present ceiling of category 3 of the Financial Perspective would be necessary.
present	present_adj-nou	That wording insists on rules that are even more timid than the text of Agenda 2000; once again it imposes rules that postpone decision-making and prevent discussion and clarification (by the complete subordination of the EP to the will of the present and future German Parliament); it imposes rules which, objectively speaking, are only in the interests of those who do not want to renew the Cohesion Fund in its present form but, on the contrary, are trying to relegate economic and social cohesion to a secondary role, totally subordinate to the domination of financial interests.
present	present_adj-nou	It is the fact that the present position is simply unsatisfactory that prompted our desire for a Single Sky.
present	present_adj-nou	on behalf of the ALDE Group. - The unfolding and tragic events at the Red Mosque in Islamabad show that Pakistan faces a clear and present threat from extremist ideology.
present	present_adj-nou	At present Community legislation does not contain an upper limit for the PAC content in foodstuffs.
present	present_adj-nou	However, it is not possible to vote on it as the votes are tabled at present, since we must vote on the compromise first.
present	present_adj-nou	In the present economic and financial situation, it is especially difficult to find investors for many projects.
present	present_adj-nou	At present, decision-making in the EU is too diffuse and too sluggish, which leads to alienation.
present	present_adj-nou	We want to encourage and, indeed, in some circumstances, require nation states to look at their present laws, to make sure that they are able to investigate these abuses and bring people who abuse children in this way before the appropriate courts.
present	present_adj-nou	At present, 14.4% of young people in Europe aged 18 to 24 years have less than higher secondary level education, and almost 21% of young people are unemployed.
present	present_adj-nou	The present refund rate - effective since the Management Committee's decision yesterday - is ECU 60 per tonne, that is, approximately 30 % of the value of the raw material.
present	present_adj-nou	It would be like applying small sticking plasters to a gaping wound, which will just become larger and larger with the present transport policy.
present	present_adj-nou	I ask that the Commissions look at this problem, because it is a huge problem at the present time for people who have suffered a physical injury and have an implant.
present	present_adj-nou	I am also sure that those who at present export to us from South-East Asia, as well as those in China and elsewhere from whom we will be importing vehicles in future, will be obliged to abide by these rules and apply them.
present	present_adj-nou	Congo's present options are determined by failed elections, whose outcomes have been controversial from the word go and have certainly not been universally accepted, by mass migration from the eastern neighbouring countries, regional rulers with mining interests and rebel armies.
present	None	The third point, which really concerns me, is that I believe that at the present time, the combination of the recommended longer period during which abortion will be allowed and the progress being made in science which means that potential anomalies in unborn children can be diagnosed increasingly early, plus the progress being made in bio-ethics, carries with it a risk. A certain number of doctors, and by no means the least progressive - I am thinking, in the case of France, for example, of Professor Nisand - would agree with me on this point, and the risk is that this combination of circumstances might lead, tomorrow, either directly or indirectly, somewhere, to a system of State eugenics which would prejudice the founding of a peoples' Europe which is what we are all hoping to achieve.
present	present_adj-nou	Many people in Germany, in particular, are worried at present; they are upset about what lies ahead.
present	present_adj-nou	In order, however, to overcome the present crisis of confidence felt by the citizens of Europe with regard to the European Union, we must, I believe, play fair right down the line with the citizens themselves, their elected representatives, their trade unions and their associations, in other words, before taking decisions we should agree to expose the options to the light of day, enable transparent pluralist assessment of the effects of these decisions once implemented and we should dare, if necessary, to change our heading if, perchance, society' s priorities happen to upset the agenda of the Community' s elected officials.
present	present_vrb	I will briefly present these discrepancies in the form of questions.
present	present_adj-nou	It reminds us that, at present in Haiti, apart from the conditions of poverty and the feeling of insecurity that prevail among the citizens (60% of the population are living outside and 80% are living in absolute poverty), there is acute concern about the situation of the most vulnerable persons, who face violence, sexual abuse, human trafficking, exploitation and abandonment.
present	present_adj-nou	At present we estimate that some EUR 500 million will be needed in 2000 and EUR 500-700 million needed in 2001 and 2002.
present	None	I know that at present our curiosity is being stirred more by the calculations than by the guidelines, and so I am counting on this document being smoothly voted through tomorrow.
present	present_adj-nou	We had agreed with the Commission that further posts should be filled in DG VIII and that the money for these posts, on which we cannot take a decision, should be used by the Commission for DG VIII, so that NGO projects, which at present cannot be implemented because of lack of staff, can go ahead.
present	present_adj-nou	The only people who are therefore eligible for this programme are students whose parents can pay the remaining sum, unless the Member States assume responsibility for doing so, which is not the case at present.
present	present_adj-nou	But, in order to be fulfilled, ambitions - like good intentions - require a certain political climate and general conditions which, in my opinion, do not exist at present and which the Commission should set about creating.
present	None	This break in the talks on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 could and should present us with an opportunity to reintroduce the issue via the creation of a separate budget heading.
present	present_adj-nou	The fact, however, that nine opposition parties boycotted the second round of the elections, the fact that the Albanian electoral committee itself felt obliged to declare the elections invalid in 17 constituencies and the fact that no international observers were present when the new elections took place in those 17 constituencies do not say much for the progress being made towards democratization in Albania.
present	present_adj-nou	The EU-Latin America summit, by the way, takes place exactly in the middle of the two stages of the election, and it is therefore not certain whether the Colombian President will be present at this conference in Vienna.
present	present_adj-nou	I should also like to thank the Commissioner responsible, who is present in the Chamber today, for his willingness to compromise on many points of detail that were of crucial significance for Parliament.
present	present_adj-nou	I therefore believe that education about Europe’s past and present, and the cultures that we experience and live in, is an important precondition for a more peaceful and cohesive Europe that will continue to develop its legal system and views on values and culture.
present	present_adj-nou	As Commissioner Papoutsis cannot be present this evening and as our debate will have to be interrupted at 5.30 for Commission Question Time, with the consent of the House I now invite Commissioner Papoutsis to speak.
present	present_adj-nou	It is simple: it was my duty to escort the Queen of the Netherlands here and to be present for her speech.
present	present_adj-nou	During our last part-session, the various oral questions relating to this subject were put back to a later date, specifically the present part-session, according to the Members present, at any event.
present	present_adj-nou	As mentioned in the present proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (the CoE Convention) - already signed by 20 European Union countries, is the first international legal instrument to classify as crimes the various forms of sexual abuse of children, including abuse committed, inter alia, using force, coercion or threats, even within the family.
present	present_adj-nou	A satellite-based toll system also promises more for the future, firstly, because it can – provided that the political will is present – provide comprehensive and cross-border coverage of vehicles, and, secondly, because – as my colleague Mr Swoboda said – it provides a basis on which future traffic flows can be directed and on which different modes of transport can be logistically interlinked. Thirdly, it will be possible to use it in combination with mobile communications technology as a means towards introducing other services, such as, for example, rapid help in the event of accidents, local hazard warnings and the tracking of dangerous goods, to name but a few.
present	present_adj-nou	Although the opposition was strongly against these amendments and was not present in the chamber at the time of the vote, the cameras were able to expose the fraud taking place.
present	present_vrb	The result is that the provisions, on the one hand, go against the acquis communautaire, particularly the 2001 Directive on copyright, and, on the other hand, present a considerable risk for creation and cultural diversity, by undermining the national laws that curb such behaviour, prejudicing as it does the rights of authors and performers.
present	present_vrb	Before the Commission begins the negotiations about a new agreement, and before extending such an agreement, it must present an assessment of the essential elements.
present	present_vrb	We shall have to think about this, and, when the time comes, present our proposals on the subject to the Council and Parliament.
present	present_vrb	It contains some good proposals, which the Commission will hopefully incorporate into its proposal on the new common organisation of the market in wine that it is due to present to us in the summer.
present	present_vrb	I also think it a good thing, therefore, that a Member State must present an action plan and state how it plans to reduce congestion.
present	present_vrb	Madam President, I believe we are on the right track, and I have no doubt that in September the Commission will be able to present the elements that will allow you to definitely give discharge for the 1996 financial year.
present	present_vrb	Finally, I am so proud of the Cypriot Nobel prize winner, Christoforos Pissalides, that I call on the European Parliament to invite him to present his views as to how unemployment and the challenges of our times should be addressed.
present	present_vrb	A deliberate decision was taken to present the Commission’s social and employment goals differently to the way in which they had been in the previous Social Agenda.
present	present_vrb	The Commission' s proposed strategy is to adopt the wording of the convention, more or less, as it stands and to present the Member States with a situation where they have already agreed to this very text and there is, therefore, now no reason to convert it into another instrument that sets a clear time for its transposition.
present	present_vrb	Will the Commission present an annual report to the Parliament?
present	present_vrb	The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee - I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that, but still - and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks.
present	present_vrb	With the aim of guaranteeing greater protection of the environment, the Commission will present two additional directives during this year and, in this respect, I would say to Mrs McNally that, before the end of the year, I hope to present a directive on behalf of the Commission intended to promote cogeneration and at the same time prevent certain fraudulent uses which we all know about and which in the end lead to greater expense and wastage of electricity.
present	present_adj-nou	It fails to provide an adequate living for many fishermen and, at the same time, it fails to conserve fish stocks for present and future generations.
present	present_adj-nou	These maximum levels do not apply to three substances: estragole, safrole and methyleugenol, when present in compound foods to which no flavourings have been added and only food ingredients with flavouring properties in the form of herbs and/or spices have been added.
present	present_adj-nou	I ask them, and all you, the few Members still present here during the discussion of this important topic, to consider the following: if they have come to know of such serious infringements of the law in cases of foreigners who are politically quite irrelevant to the Hungarian State and Hungarian Government, what may be the fate of those who are opponents of the Hungarian Government, let us say because they are politically opposed to the government?
present	present_adj-nou	(FR) As I once said in Strasbourg, when the present times have passed, when we will all have been gone for many years and when men seek to recount the human adventure that we lived, they will - irrespective of our religious or philosophical convictions - be unable to say more than that the people of those times, of that century, lived together the immense adventure of Christian civilisation.
present	present_vrb	That said, I have chosen not to vote in favour of the resolution as it contains a number of factual errors, omits vital information and does not present an objective picture of the violence that occurred on 8 November 2010.
produce	produce_vrb	Part of it was that the negotiations must produce results within a given time frame, which was deliberately made very short.
produce	produce_vrb	As you know, President Prodi, the credibility of the euro is linked, amongst other things - above all, I would say - to the Stability and Growth Pact and to its capacity to force the Member States to produce responsible budgetary policies: budgetary policies, I would point out, which they themselves have proposed and which are accepted by all their citizens.
produce	None	The fact is that this project will not produce a peace agreement, but will simply let the conflict in the region simmer on.
produce	produce_vrb	Despite the protestations of the Commissioner, it is plain that this report is about harmonising taxes: it seek to produce a harmonised regime for vehicle taxation in the European Union.
produce	produce_vrb	Would it be possible for the Commission to produce a rough estimate of what it costs to implement it in each Member State, how the cost in one Member State compares with another and how it compares with the total expenditure associated with cross-compliance?
produce	produce_vrb	So it is up to the Member States to make the most of all these possibilities provided by the European Union's legal framework and, at the same time, to utilise the Community finance available from various Community programmes to help industry produce cheaper technology, while at the same time making it possible for the regions and large cities of the Member States to exploit the new technologies for making use of renewable energy sources.
produce	produce_nou	This programme must be incorporated into the second pillar, and the way to do this is to take what has actually been done, to take this scheme that was launched as an environmental programme and turned into an innovation and marketing programme for special organic produce, and to combine it all with a structural programme for the integrated development of rural areas.
produce	None	We first have to change what is no longer acceptable in our European Union, for example the way in which we produce meat.
produce	produce_vrb	Let us hope, then, that the Madrid Conference will produce results that come up to our expectations.
produce	produce_vrb	These amendments were also aimed at protecting customary, time-honoured methods of production which date back to the 15th century, and which should be employed in accordance with the traditions of the countries that were the first to produce such beverages.
produce	produce_vrb	What sort of cooperation can we be getting from state institutions in Germany when a company can produce feed mixes without, at the same time, being registered in a system of control?
produce	produce_vrb	I am appealing to you on behalf of the people who are trying to produce the food.
produce	produce_vrb	For us, the question of administrative costs is a minor problem compared with that of the overall capacity of our regulations and our institutions to produce legislation that is clear, can be applied in a fair and balanced manner, is unambiguous and, above all, is not open to varying interpretations.
produce	produce_vrb	When the world has plenty of food, then perhaps Europe does not need altogether to do its share of production, but when the world is short of food and the prices go up, then Europe is morally obliged to produce food.
produce	produce_vrb	It will reinforce the promotion of high-quality European brands, and will rightly inspire pride in citizens for what Europeans still manage to produce, despite the competition from cheap labour.
produce	produce_vrb	Its current president is trying to turn it into a state that represents the most extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism, that supports or does not condemn terrorist acts, and that is preparing to produce nuclear energy without the backing of the international community.
produce	produce_vrb	This is good news especially for those countries whose farmers should make too large investments to produce just one of the 3 milk categories accepted until now.
produce	produce_vrb	First, the report calls on the Commission to produce a detailed assessment of the costs and the share of private and public funding of each of the twelve demonstration facilities.
produce	produce_vrb	This is a good basis and starting point for the aim of offering our citizens an environment in which levels of pollution are not enough to produce harmful effects on people’s health and the environment.
produce	produce_vrb	A simple European forestry strategy would be sufficient to encourage us to produce wood in Europe in a sustainable manner and to reject imports from tropical or boreal forests that often come from felled areas.
produce	produce_vrb	How can I explain to European farmers that they are not allowed to produce certain products when other countries are, and when we are allowed to import such products without restrictions?
produce	produce_vrb	The aim is life-long learning; to produce a new type of specialist graduate equipped with superior rural development, advisory and management skills.
produce	produce_vrb	This mix, however, provides a number of opportunities for a combination of the various policies to produce a much larger aggregate effect.
produce	produce_vrb	What is needed here, quite simply, is the very careful drafting of any proposal for legislation; it is self-evident that we have to do something about this, and that things cannot carry on the way they are, but our expectation is that the Commission should actually produce that proposal, and that we should then be able to get to grips with it with all the ways and means afforded by parliamentary debate.
produce	produce_vrb	I should also like this agriculture to produce pears that taste like pears, apples that taste like apples, cherries that taste like cherries and peaches that taste like peaches; but above all, Mr President, I should like mint – which is my favourite flavour – to have, continue to have and have even more of the taste and perfume of mint, which gives me so much pleasure and which I adore.
produce	produce_vrb	However, some EU countries produce unsellable wines at the cost of EUR 500 million a year.
produce	produce_vrb	Now, large profits are generally the result of taking large risks and, when the risks produce not profits but losses, there is a great temptation temporarily to hide those losses in order quickly to offset them by a profit based on still greater risk-taking.
produce	produce_vrb	Besides, those vineyards are not the ones responsible for Community overproduction; on the contrary, in most cases they produce wines of excellent quality.
produce	produce_vrb	These crops produce sterile seeds so farmers will be unable to save seeds from one year’s crops to sow the next, forcing them into buying seeds each year from biotech corporations whose control over seeds is already enormous: just ten corporations control more than 50% of global seed sales.
produce	produce_vrb	There are people across Europe processing the waste that we all produce.
produce	produce_nou	For that reason, they have to have better access to our market for their industrial manufactured goods and agricultural produce.
produce	produce_nou	Two things touched me particularly: firstly, the fate of the people there who were forced to flee, only some of whom have been able to return to cultivate their fields, and who of course have difficulty selling their produce over a border that has suddenly been drawn through their country.
produce	produce_vrb	In addition, we should ask the standards institutes to produce proposals which will make this possible.
progress	progress_nou	However, I should like to emphasise our need to make further progress now.
progress	progress_nou	Similarly, in the case of Romania, progress in the fields of justice and home affairs, especially the reform of the judiciary system and the fight against corruption, competition and state aid, the environment and agriculture will be crucial.
progress	progress_nou	The Commission proved capable of diligently implementing the new provisions of the Financial Regulation. Progress was noted in all areas.
progress	progress_nou	In this context the expectations for Bonn concentrated on the need to make substantial technical progress.
progress	None	Those who have practised sport have developed a fighting spirit and a capacity for sacrifice, as well as self-respect and respect for others: all qualities which build a person's character and help him to progress through life.
progress	progress_nou	. (ES) As part of the work of the Convention and in thinking about drawing up a Constitution that will enable us not only to successfully complete the enlargement process that is in progress but above all to provide the European Union with a democratic and effective government that responds to the challenges and concerns of the world in which we live, dividing competences between the European Union and the Member States is essential.
progress	progress_nou	We are not doing it for the sake of the mystical market forces but for the sake of sustainable growth and job creation in Europe, by ensuring that the threats to financial stability will not kill the economic recovery that is now in progress - though this is still rather modest and fragile.
progress	progress_vrb	But the greater need remains to progress towards a carcass trade rather than sustaining live exports for slaughter.
progress	progress_nou	As its name indicates, PROGRESS stands for progress and social solidarity, and that is why this House saw it as important that it should be rolled out, as planned, at the beginning of January 2007, and that is what we are, by this vote, going to be able to do, now that the Council has accommodated our wishes.
progress	progress_nou	Without that spirit and cooperation we will not be able to achieve real progress.
progress	progress_nou	A great deal of progress has been made thanks to successive presidencies, particularly in Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne.
progress	progress_nou	I think that we have to begin to toughen up on the need to apply sanctions or suspend agreements if we are going to make progress in this area.
progress	progress_nou	Although Kazakhstan is not a western liberal democracy in our tradition, it is making considerable progress as a multi-religious, secular, Muslim-majority country.
progress	progress_nou	However, we also need to promote sustainable gear and sustainable fishing, which means that we have to make progress on the definition of small-scale fishing, which is something that undoubtedly needs greater clarification.
progress	progress_nou	We Defence Ministers of the Member States can only be grateful for any progress in the European Parliament and hope that it sets an example.
progress	progress_nou	As the honourable Member recognises, considerable progress has already been made and we welcome this.
progress	progress_nou	The progress made by Croatia with the operation of the free market is recognised and note is made of the achievements of Croatia, both in the year on year increase in gross national product over recent years and in the reduction in the level of inflation, which is close to the European Union average.
progress	progress_nou	The Commission must provide an annual presentation of the progress made in integrating the dimension of sustainable development in all Community policies.
progress	progress_nou	It is, however, a debate on the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice.
progress	progress_nou	The tremendous progress which countries in Asia have made proves this point, Korea being a prime example.
progress	progress_nou	"In subsequent reviews, the Commission will report, in particular, on progress towards attaining our long-term goals and, with these aims in mind, will consider what further measures are necessary to achieve these goals, as the rapporteur has said, ""preferably by 2020""."
progress	progress_nou	Mr President, I would like to point out that the first objective laid down in the Treaty on European Union is to promote economic progress.
progress	progress_nou	In the summary report on progress made by the Union and its Member States in achieving the millennium development targets, the cooperation between the platform and the millennium targets is taken into consideration.
progress	progress_nou	So far as Bulgaria is concerned, I agree with the assessment made by the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, and would like to say for my part, too, that remarkable progress has been made.
progress	progress_nou	I need not repeat my strong conviction that the progress made so far, thanks to the political will of the Council and Parliament, needs to take concrete form as soon as possible through the adoption of the proposal for a regulation.
progress	progress_nou	Admittedly we have not got the Constitution, but we do say that this Reform Treaty represents progress in every respect.
progress	progress_nou	The judicial system, as I have said, is starting to improve and we are also seeing progress on child protection – requested by our own Parliament, incidentally – even though it is possible to go further.
progress	progress_nou	What certainly is the case though is that, in order for the citizens to have faith in science, knowledge of scientific progress must be disseminated in a comprehensible manner and the public’s awareness must be improved, so that there is greater understanding of the real challenges and implications for our lives.
progress	progress_nou	Yet you continuously refused to initiate a debate on the setting up of a social and environmental development fund financed by a tax on capital movements and the upward harmonisation of taxation on capital, on the creation of money by the European Central Bank for the repurchase of the debt of Member States, and on the development of public services that are crucial for justice and social progress.
progress	progress_nou	Nevertheless, progress varies significantly between countries and across themes, with aggregate selection rates at about 40% in the case of nine Member States and below 20% in four Member States.
progress	progress_nou	The Belarusian authorities have made some progress, which is commendable, but we hope that they will initiate a process of democratisation and not simply make some temporary cosmetic gesture.
progress	progress_nou	Our Group is delighted at the definite progress made at the Lisbon Summit but, at the same time, we would be lying if we did not say that our Group considers that we still do not have sufficient political momentum and ambition to transform the European Union of today into the European Union that we need for the future of the European people.
progress	progress_nou	If the presidency is to succeed in making progress on this important issue, then it must persuade the Union's Member States not just to give political support to the Confidence Pact on Employment, but also to provide the funding to implement the proposals and construct the TENs projects put forward by President Santer.
progress	progress_nou	We share the view of those who are rediscussing the scope of EU foreign policy and consider that it cannot continue to look to the north of the Community and to Central and Eastern Europe, although these are certainly important regions of the old continent, finally restored to democracy and socio-economic progress. We should in fact also be deeply concerned to see the Mediterranean region resume its historical role as a linchpin, a bridge between cultures and human and economic societies.
progress	progress_nou	Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Council and the Commission on the progress made at Tampere in so many areas and I would like to associate myself with the remarks made earlier by my Liberal Democrat colleague Baroness Ludford.
progress	progress_nou	A year after the failed American-backed coup, which was tacitly tolerated by the European Union and openly supported by Spain, which then had the presidency, the enemies of progress, democracy and social justice have again tried to overthrow President Chavez and the constitutional order.
progress	progress_nou	Owing to technological progress, those ideas on children’s rights must now also be linked into cyber security, as we have seen the Internet – despite its wonderful intent, brilliant innovation and the opportunities it presents to us all – being used by people who wish to corrupt innocent minds and pervert the use of the Internet through trafficking in paedophilia and child pornography.
progress	progress_nou	We are aware of the progress made in road holding, in resistance to wear and tear, in reducing fuel consumption, but for known technical reasons the investments in research and technology do not yet allow all the rapporteur' s demands to be reconciled.
progress	progress_nou	The attempt nonetheless to push through the PROGRESS programme, the cost of which will exceed EUR 1 billion between 2007 and 2013, shows a lack of respect for the Council’s decision.
progress	progress_nou	It is a practical achievement to have adopted the wording concerned. It demonstrates to Europeans, who appear increasingly to doubt the value of our project of European construction, that our continent is making daily progress and producing practical rules to improve their daily lives – in the event, by enabling them to make conscious choices about what they eat.
progress	progress_nou	There are certain tendencies: we do not see sufficient progress, as much progress as we would like, in the move to qualified majority voting or in the co-decision processes essential to revitalize this Parliament - to give it purpose, so that it does not simply duplicate legislation passed elsewhere.
progress	progress_nou	It will be difficult to make progress in our mutual relations without improving the consistency of various Union policies, such as the trade, development, environmental protection, agriculture and migration policies.
progress	progress_nou	Let us therefore carry on making progress on the basis of practical projects.
progress	progress_nou	This directive will enable numerous companies to make even more progress in designing new and safer electrical and electronic equipment by encouraging technological innovation.
progress	None	If politics is a question of sacrificing individual interests for the sake of the common good, I believe that we can feel satisfied with our work on approving this report, which demonstrates that, when we work together, it is easier to make progress, and also that when a text that is balanced, and agreed amongst everybody, is presented to the governments, it is more easily accepted and therefore easier to apply.
progress	None	Nevertheless, no significant progress will be made in the matter unless the European Union strengthens its responsibilities in the field of education, health and family policies.
protest	protest_nou	However, last week's protest by Polish shipyard workers must be viewed differently.
protest	protest_nou	In this context, and against the background of the groundswell of protest against that assassination, the time has come for us to demand that Syria should comply with the wishes of the international community and totally withdraw from Lebanon, thus allowing normal elections to be held in that country.
protest	protest_vrb	Like others, I regret that we do not have a resolution in front of us in which we could have expressed our complete condemnation of police brutality and of the violence of the Black Block at Genoa, our conviction that those responsible must be brought to justice, our commitment to uphold the right to protest peacefully, and our determination to clarify the growing evidence that much of the violence and damage to property which occurred in Genoa was the work of agents provocateurs.
protest	protest_nou	I should also like to place on record a protest at the absolute lack of interest shown by many Arab countries in these peoples, a large part of them Muslim.
protest	protest_nou	We consider their protest to be legitimate and we support them.
protest	protest_nou	After the irregularities of the first round Europe thumped the table, but failed to utter even a murmur of protest.
protest	protest_nou	This is why we cannot allow the appointment of Pinochet to Chile's Senate, due on the 11 of next month, and subject to protest by all the main political parties in Chile, to pass without international protest from ourselves.
protest	protest_nou	I would also like to make it quite clear, however, that as regards the European institutions, this is not only a matter of ensuring that the European Parliament issues a protest and a repudiation.
protest	protest_nou	Mr President, it is over ten years since Aung San Suu Kyi, the President of Burma elected by 80% of the population, received both the Nobel Prize and the Sakharov Prize for her peaceful protest against the military coup and the military dictatorship in her country.
protest	protest_nou	As to the first point that you raise, clearly this is a truly shocking incident and I shall look into the most appropriate way of notifying the Dutch authorities of your legitimate protest.
protest	protest_nou	Mr President, can I say that it is rather appropriate that as we debate this very important report, and I thank the rapporteur for it, 30 Irish farmers are staging a sit-in protest in the offices of the European Commission in Dublin and they intend to stay overnight.
protest	protest_nou	Now that members of parliament are under attack in Luanda, I think it is time this House made its voice heard in protest.
protest	protest_nou	I am very willing to note your protest, Mr Pasty.
protest	None	(IT) Mr President, in the last few weeks, more than 30 Mapuche went on hunger strike to protest against the militarisation of their land, being subjected to a dual civil and military jurisdiction and the application of anti-terrorism legislation, in effect since the period of military dictatorship.
protest	protest_nou	If our resolution is directed at anyone, then in this context it should, in my opinion, be the Ukrainian citizens, who with this protest are guaranteeing that Ukraine's development as a democracy continues.
protest	protest_vrb	I will vote against all these proposed amendments, and also protest vigorously about the fact that we are discussing this report in plenary this week even though the translation was only available on Monday.
protest	protest_vrb	I protest against this ploy because it is fundamentally untrue.
protest	None	I respect and hold in high regard those Muslims, in particular, who, in Austria and elsewhere, have made their protest in a clear but peaceful manner.
protest	protest_vrb	I must also protest at the threats being issued by the UK Government, which tells us that if we vote against voluntary modulation it will compromise the future of the popular agri-environment schemes in which many UK farmers have participated.
protest	protest_vrb	Mr President, let me protest once again.
protest	protest_vrb	I want to call upon you to protest most vigorously, on behalf of Parliament, against what is now happening in Azerbaijan.
protest	protest_vrb	I voted against the motion for a resolution (A4-0360/98) on the Draft General Budget of the European Union for the financial year 1999 to protest against the neglect of and discrimination against the tourism sector and the fact that Amendment No 75 was rejected, thus preventing the inclusion of any budget heading on measures to help tourism and thereby depriving it of funding.
protest	protest_vrb	If the pace of implementation continues to be slow, there will be a risk in future years of a situation arising in which regions that have received promises of aid and candidate countries that have been given generous promises of pre-accession aid will, quite justifiably, protest when the promises are not fulfilled.
protest	protest_vrb	Mr President, I wish to protest again this year that the amendment tabled by my delegation on the 2005 calendar, which seeks to end this charade of coming to Strasbourg every month at gross expense to the European Union taxpayer, has been declared inadmissible.
protest	protest_vrb	We know that many initiatives are taking shape in China for the purpose of mass protest against the violation of minimum environmental standards.
protest	protest_vrb	I would like to take the opportunity, Madam President, to protest strongly and ask that you, yourself, do the same before the Council, for the representative of the Council, in the Conference of Presidents, gave a piece of information which I understand to be inaccurate, if not completely untrue, in relation to Council meetings.
protest	protest_vrb	Mr President, on a point of order, I should like to ask you to write to President Bush and the Governor of Texas to protest against the execution by lethal injection of the British citizen, Jackie Elliott, last week, despite mounting evidence that he was innocent of the crime for which he had been convicted and was on death row for 16 years.
protest	protest_vrb	Mr President, I just wanted to protest at the decision of a majority of the Conference of Presidents not to send a delegation from the European Parliament to the first hearing of the trial of Leyla Zana, who is of course a Sakharov Prize laureate.
protest	protest_vrb	So I would like to vigorously condemn and protest against the anti democratic and illegal abuse I have received from Mr Pat Cox, President of Parliament, who has refused to include in this part-session two questions which I have presented in relation to two possible violations of the Rules of Law, of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Mr Aznar and his Spanish Government.
protest	protest_vrb	(PL) Mr President, I wish to use the forum of the European Parliament to protest against the unlawful termination by the National Fund for Environmental Protection, which is subordinate to the Polish Government, of its contract with the Lux Veritatis Foundation to implement a geothermal investment for Toruń, while at the same time announcing that there will be no refund of the vast sums that the Foundation has spent on this investment.
protest	None	The European Parliament building is not a meeting house for every group that wants to have a protest at this or that problem throughout the world.
protest	None	I also wonder to what extent those who called American agents in Cuba human rights activists will articulate even one word in protest against the new escalation of aggression against the island of the revolution.
protest	protest_vrb	We deplore the terrorist attacks, but we protest at the limitations to the full exercise of our rights, in spite of the fact that we know very well that the perpetrators are abusing our democratic system.
protest	protest_vrb	We tear our hair out and protest about Khodorkovsky, but precious little is said about Lukashenko’s anonymous victims.
protest	protest_nou	I must ask you, Mr Schulz, where were you between 2002 and 2010, when your socialist comrades in power in Hungary had every single anti-government protest dispersed by force?
reading	reading_en	Now that we have chosen this path, I hope that the Council will approve a number of rational and very logical requests by this Parliament at second reading too.
reading	reading_en	The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0278/98), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0306/98-96/0117(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive relating to coffee extracts and chicory extracts (Rapporteur: Mr Lannoye).
reading	reading_en	Thus, maintaining the amendment would scupper our joint efforts and the objective of facilitating a first reading agreement under the codecision procedure.
reading	reading_en	Mr Seppänen, thank you very much for your words and for your efforts as rapporteur on a subject which has been difficult, but which has had a happy outcome, as you yourself have said; namely, the agreement at first reading to solve the legal problems that had arisen surrounding the external mandate of the European Investment Bank or EIB.
reading	reading_en	I think, therefore, that we should make it very clear in the title that it is a support programme in the fields of books and reading, primarily through translation.
reading	reading_en	Recommendation for second reading (A5-0038/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the Youth Community action programme [13175/1/1999 - C5-0022/1999 - 1998/0197(COD)] (rapporteur: Mrs Gröner)
reading	reading_en	Regarding the next issue - the Financial Regulation - I hope that we will achieve a first reading approach, because this would be very good for the implementation of the regulation in the future.
reading	reading_en	As far as the ethical framework of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned, the rules proposed by the Commission are in line with Parliament's amendment made at first reading on the Sixth Framework Programme as well as with the opinion of the European Group on Ethics.
reading	reading_en	I would also point out that, at first reading, the Council increased appropriations in its draft budget in order to launch Eurojust and the SISII system for Schengen.
reading	reading_en	As rapporteur, I would have liked both the Council and the Commission to move a little further towards our position as adopted at first reading.
reading	reading_en	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think Parliament has done its homework very well, in that it has done everything it can to get through second reading as quickly as possible.
reading	reading_en	Mr President, it is just as well that this is the second reading, when we should have just been fine-tuning a few positions!
reading	reading_en	I am hopeful that, in preparing its first reading, Parliament will seek to redress this situation.
reading	reading_en	Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament for the efforts to complete its first reading of the proposal for a directive on insurance mediation.
reading	reading_en	The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0239/98), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Regulation concerning the granting of Community financial assistance for actions of an innovative nature to promote combined transport (C4-0173/98-96/0207(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mr Ulrich Stockmann).
reading	reading_en	As draftsman of the opinion on the proposal for a CITES Regulation, I should like to say that I am particularly satisfied, because the Council's common position endorses the opinion tabled at first reading by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.
reading	reading_en	I know that at second reading there will be a lot of work between the Council, Parliament and the Commission to find the right balance between these two elements: industry's drive and the positive experience we have with this energy label.
reading	reading_en	"Yet, when reading the explanatory statement, we find some perfectly inadmissible statements such as this, ""the economic situation no longer allows the same level of social protection for European workers: there is unfortunately a direct link between social protection and what separates us from full employment."""
reading	reading_en	At first reading on 6 September 2001, I spoke in favour of an opt-in instead of an opt-out.
reading	reading_en	A number of the European Parliament's amendments were already adopted at first reading - we are now discussing the second reading.
reading	reading_en	Since many of the amendments proposed by the Parliament at first reading have been taken into account, I personally find that the view of the Parliament has been incorporated into the common position to a sufficient extent.
reading	reading_en	Mr President, I should just like to thank the rapporteur and the Members once again for their excellent work, and to say that we are looking forward to a first-reading agreement.
reading	reading_en	I would like to thank the rapporteur explicitly for dealing so seriously with this subject, both at first reading and now at second reading.
reading	reading_en	The 126 rights in the report make for some painful reading and provide a sorry but striking example of the fact that Parliament must not concern itself with everything.
reading	reading_en	At the first reading by the Council in July, under the Dutch Presidency, 25 Member States will be represented, and the MEPs from 25 Member States will take part in the first parliamentary reading in October.
reading	reading_en	Bloch von Blottnitz recommendation for second reading
reading	reading_en	It is vital to reach an agreement within the Council without further delay, particularly for the Member States, and we are delighted at the announcement of an agreement on a number of directives adopted by Parliament at first reading and now blocked: the Working Time Directive - but we hope that this agreement takes the same direction as the European Parliament’s vote at first reading, in other words abolishes the opt-out, and I am sure you will tell us if this is the case – the Temporary Agency Workers Directive, the revision of the European Work Councils Directive to increase employees’ rights when faced with restructuring, and, finally, the drafting of a framework directive on services of general interest.
reading	reading_en	At first reading, in 2010, Parliament approved amendments to rules on origin marking, indication of animal-derived materials, use of language-independent symbols and a review clause, but the Council did not accept everything.
reading	reading_en	Many of the problems apparent in the legislation at first reading have been substantially resolved by the Council at second reading.
reading	reading_en	I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for continuing to resist the pressures of the Council and the Commission, which may have endorsed some amendments, ladies and gentlemen, but which endorsed the insignificant amendments. The essential amendments which you had proposed and which we had voted on during the first reading were not endorsed.
reading	reading_en	We must also address an issue which was avoided at first reading, and that is the question of the control of the import and export of GMO crops and other GMO products.
reading	reading_en	One of the great improvements in comparison to the first reading relates to access to the 112 European emergency number, and the obligation of operators to make caller location available without any derogation on the grounds of technical feasibility, at least for fixed and mobile telephone operators.
reading	reading_en	Financial perspectives will be examined extremely sceptically and legislation (after first reading) will meet with strong protest.
reading	reading_en	Recommendation for second reading (A5-0083/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Directive 90/220/EEC (11216/1/1999 - C5-0012/2000 - 1998/0072(COD)) (rapporteur: Mr Bowe)
reading	reading_en	As a result, the recommendation for second reading proposes that the amendments which approximate to the position and spirit of the amendments adopted by Parliament in part-session should be reinstated.
reading	reading_en	Recommendation for second reading (A5-0079/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC [13292/1/2000 - C5-0002/2001 - 2000/0015(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf) and
reading	reading_en	Abstention also expresses my inability to agree with a reading which, in presenting concrete data supplied by the Commission, draws conclusions that have long been clearly invalid.
rebel	rebel_vrb	I nonetheless rebel against the obstacles that impede the recovery of waste, which – supported by the Court of Justice’s judgement in case C-228/00 – will penalise my country’s cement manufacturers.
rebel	rebel_vrb	This is the point UK farmers rebel against.
rebel	rebel_nou	This marks yet another outbreak of violence between government forces and the rebel movement but, as we know, violence is not the way to resolve complex and sensitive conflicts.
rebel	rebel_nou	After the terrible images of the invasion and the scandal of the Abu Ghraib prison, there is now the controversial issue of the white phosphorous bombs allegedly used in the siege of Falluja, a rebel town, but also a martyred town.
rebel	rebel_nou	I have just come back from Yemen where, together with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Gutierrez, we engaged on the humanitarian access issue with high-level government officials and representatives of the al-Houthi rebel movement.
rebel	rebel_nou	For the first time since the start of this distressing affair, rebel activity has intensified and has carried on for over six months, breaking the traditional mould of cycles of violence which initially took the form of brief raids rather than permanent conflict.
rebel	rebel_nou	At the same time, it has also emerged that the separatist rebel leader, Aslan Maskhadov, and his followers, have lost the better part of the support of civil society.
rebel	rebel_nou	Since the end of May, the Indonesian military have arrested or killed almost two thousand people suspected of belonging to the GAM rebel group, a movement that demands autonomy for Aceh.
rebel	rebel_nou	The rebel group must denounce violence and lay down their arms, but at the same time the Government of Burundi must cease to provide impunity and to cover up for criminals within the security forces who carry out torture and illegal detention.
rebel	rebel_nou	Your experience, Mr Prime Minister, as a rebel in one sense, as an intellectual but, most importantly of all, as a democrat and as the voice of reason that could lead your country from the dark ages of Communism into the bright lights - sometimes dimmed because of energy crises - and future of the European Union, that kind of image and that kind of imagery is what is most important to the people of Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo and, indeed, Turkey.
rebel	rebel_nou	I also believe it a strategically important option for the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, to establish contact with representatives of the rebel Interim Transitional National Council in order to speed up the process of official recognition of that body.
rebel	rebel_nou	Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned the extent to which action by rebel forces in N'Djamena had delayed the mission, but some mention must also be made of the lack of means at the disposal of the European Union to deal with this kind of mission, particularly concerning logistics and helicopters.
rebel	rebel_nou	Usually these were armed rebel groups in developing countries with no concern for human life and they had been supplied by non-western countries.
rebel	rebel_nou	In point of fact, I would of course have met in Goma the rebel leader, their self-proclaimed chief, I imagine, Mr Kabila.
rebel	rebel_nou	After all, it really is futile to call for round tables and discussions and arrange meetings between rebel leaders who may sit down and talk together for a day while the others go on shooting each other.
rebel	rebel_nou	The release of the hostages on 13 July, the arrest of the rebel leader and his main associates on 26 July and the efforts of the Government to reinstate law and order give some cause for satisfaction.
rebel	rebel_nou	Torture, detention and forced labour are common practice. Despite the government's denials, I believe that children are still forced to join the army and also, I regret to say, the rebel military forces.
rebel	rebel_nou	What is the Council doing in relation to Chad's own domestic instability given the recent gun battles in Eastern Chad on 26 November where the Chad army supposedly killed hundreds of rebel fighters?
rebel	rebel_nou	It is difficult for an official body like ours to involve non-governmental players in the negotiations, but it is good that we as an official body should urge the countries not to stockpile landmines and that we should support the NGOs that are striving to get the terrorist organisations and rebel movements to forsake the use of landmines.
rebel	rebel_nou	In the depths of the crisis and at the height of the offensive by Laurent Nkunda's rebel forces, the European Union mobilised vigorously, followed by the rest of the international community.
rebel	rebel_nou	Arms trafficking in the region also encourages more rebel unrest, while compromising the process of establishing independence.
rebel	rebel_nou	The rebel movement, the FNL, has denied all involvement, but nor does it support the peace process.
rebel	rebel_nou	I should also refer to the use of rape as a weapon used deliberately for political purposes both by the partisans on the rebel side and by the police and the army on the government side.
rebel	rebel_nou	Politically, the situation is complicated by splits and regrouping among the non-signatory rebel movements as well as the Government's refusal to consider reopening the deadlocked Peace Agreement.
rebel	rebel_nou	The political situation bears many of the hallmarks of a civil war and it must not be allowed to deteriorate into a dirty war, where the forces of law and order constantly use torture, hostages are taken and lawlessness characterises the fight against rebel forces.
rebel	rebel_nou	We would suggest that the European Union and the Member States need to get more actively involved in the DRC and the Great Lakes region, focusing very much on rapid disarmament of the rebel forces.
rebel	rebel_nou	Meanwhile, President Gbagbo has announced his intention to liberate rebel-held zones in the North and West of the country should the New Forces refuse to disarm.
rebel	rebel_nou	This operation is going to go ahead, and such remarks are simply not helpful when it comes to aiding this mission's perception and eventual reception among the local population in Chad and among the rebel groups.
rebel	rebel_nou	The frequency of attacks on refugee camps is likely to increase as the militia and rebel groups become more mobile now that the rains have subsided.
rebel	rebel_nou	Yes, the rebel attack was on a legitimate and recognised authority, and yes, action must be taken against it.
rebel	rebel_nou	Continued violations of the ceasefire by both the Sudanese Government and the rebel factions deepen insecurity and instability.
rebel	rebel_nou	As long ago as March, both sides were given a code of conduct, whereupon rebel leaders were released from prison.
rebel	rebel_nou	We therefore call on the King to restore democracy, call fresh elections and lift the restrictions on the media; to call for a follow-up to the 2002 London International Conference; to set out the principles to underpin a peace process in Nepal and to bring together King Gyanendra, the Maoist rebel groups and the main political parties.
rebel	rebel_nou	Emergency aid has arrived except in the rebel-held areas, which the humanitarian aid convoys cannot reach because of the rains, which is why there is no complete check on the conditions there.
record	None	in writing. - I wish to record that I support this report on Extension of the EC-USA agreement for scientific and technological cooperation.
record	record_nou	We have shown by our record that a strong health and safety record judged by outcomes is entirely compatible with flexible labour markets and flexible working hours.
record	record_nou	With that record of failure radical reform is long overdue and I am pleased to see that such proposals are central to the policy strategy for 2003.
record	record_nou	Well, I believe that there are only successes in my record and only good intentions behind my actions.
record	record_nou	However, the record will show that I said we had a care of duty - a responsibility - to the 110 000 jobs.
record	record_vrb	Before coming to the contents of these conclusions, I would like to record that the presidency of the Council has actually spoken on the Visby summit in Parliament already, in a debate here on 17 April.
record	record_nou	His extradition by the Italian authorities was obtained in record time.
record	record_nou	That is why the turnout in the European elections in June was down to a record low.
record	record_nou	I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.
record	record_nou	As the previous speaker mentioned, Zimbabwe is one of the world record holders (in negative terms) in this respect.
record	record_nou	This is certainly a substantial contribution - albeit not to a large enough degree - to the recently constituted Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, a fund strongly called for by the Italian Prime Minister too during the G8 Summit in Genoa and - I would add - which was made available in record time compared with the time which these things usually take.
record	record_nou	But this touches on something of a very fundamental political nature, and merely technical responses to a record which shows a difference in votes may not be enough.
record	None	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the preamble of the joint motion for a resolution is very enlightening: economic stagnation, unemployment at record level, sluggish demand, declining public investment, depression amongst businesses and consumers.
recount	recount_vrb	On the contrary, I believe that we must seek solutions and, for example, the European Parliament should promote and sponsor an international conference for peace in the Middle East, a second instalment of the one held in Madrid ten years ago, from which Mr Solana could no doubt recount many experiences.
recount	recount_nou	In view of all this, in my opinion it makes perfect sense, as paragraph 11 of the joint motion for a resolution of Parliament states, to demand that new elections be called if it is impossible for an independent institution to organise a clean, transparent and credible recount of the votes cast in the 27 December elections.
recount	recount_vrb	I will not take time to recount the dire straits in which many producers in that sector find themselves, rather I want to focus on what I believe the Commissioner should be doing to help.
recount	recount_vrb	I do not intend to recount how many times Jewish cemeteries have suffered arson attacks and desecration, or describe to you the various racist attacks that have taken place.
recount	recount_vrb	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I was a member of the delegation from our Group which visited Turkey. I do not want to recount my experiences at length, I just want to tell you what my impression was.
recount	recount_vrb	An extra effort to recount this success story is therefore called for.
recount	recount_vrb	The Treaty, Brazil and Africa are achievements, and achievements for the benefit of Europe, but I have to say, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, that there is not time here to recount, even in summary, all the achievements of the Portuguese Presidency, but I would like to tell you, albeit briefly, that this Presidency has left its mark on the main items on the European agenda and I would like to begin with the agenda regarding freedoms.
recount	recount_vrb	Ladies and gentlemen, before detailing the preparations we are making for the meeting in Geneva, I should like briefly to recount the results of last year's meeting, to give you an idea of the challenges facing us in March and April.
recount	recount_vrb	I would like to recount a short incident that I find significant.
recount	recount_vrb	The saga of Zaventem airport would take hours to recount.
recount	recount_vrb	In this context, I am sure it will not be necessary to recount the recent negative consequences of dependence experienced by Ukraine.
recount	recount_nou	No recount was requested and I cannot set a negative precedent on the voting procedures.
recount	recount_nou	There are serious concerns regarding how ballot boxes have been stored and it cannot be ruled out that ballot papers are being tampered with in the process of this recount.
recount	recount_nou	. - (DE) Mr President, We would like to have a recount of Part 2 of paragraph (1).
recount	recount_nou	The non-publication of results and the recount in the way it has been ordered are completely absurd.
recount	recount_nou	This time the opposition won the parliamentary elections, but it seems that the proposed recount is designed to rob them of their victory.
recount	recount_nou	According to a Commission spokesman, no signs of fraud were discovered during the recount.
recount	recount_nou	Currently a recount continues in 23 constituencies at the request of the ruling Zanu-PF Party.
recount	recount_vrb	I think the very fact that Mugabe's government has delayed acknowledging the result and is trying to recount the votes indicates - and is proof - that they feel themselves defeated.
recount	None	Those who survived still recount how, between April 1992 and April 1993, thousands of refugees, in an attempt to save themselves from Bosnian Serb incursions, hid in cellars, garages and even houses abandoned by the Serbs; how they only had roots to eat; how they were infested with fleas; how, frozen during the long winter of 1992, they warmed themselves by burning tyres and plastic bottles; and how the bodies of those who died of starvation and exposure were eaten by dogs.
refund	refund_nou	Secondly, the proposal to introduce a registration and annual circulation tax refund system for vehicles exported and transferred definitively to another Member State should be adopted.
refund	refund_nou	Although for legal reasons we were unable to include this in our opinion as a formal amendment proposal, I still hope that as part of the package, as part of the overall OSS package, the speed of cooperation between authorities will increase, as this helps avoid cash-flow problems for small enterprises, problems related to VAT refund entitlement and the determination of ratios, and even abuses, because fraud and the formation of fictitious companies very often arise from an attempt to reclaim fictitious export VAT.
refund	refund_nou	Those who operate the deposit-guarantee schemes in the Scandinavian countries and the supervisory authorities there must decide for themselves whether contributions are to be reimbursed or whether deposit guarantees in those countries should be treated like insurance policies and not give rise to refund entitlements.
refund	refund_nou	Experience has shown the Committee on Petitions that in practice the right to freedom of movement comes up against a great many problems because: (a) Member State authorities are slow to transpose the rules of Community law, (b) problems arise with the recognition of diplomas and qualifications in the case of specific professions, (c) the rules on social security have not been standardised, e.g. complicated forms for the refund of medical costs.
refund	refund_nou	2. on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as regards the introduction of administrative cooperation arrangements in the context of the one-stop scheme and the refund procedure for value added tax (COM(2004)0728 – C6-0025/2005 – 2004/0262(CNS)).
refund	refund_nou	If, out of a perfectly justifiable concern for the competitive position of energy-intensive companies, they are granted an exemption, refund or reduction in energy tax, on an individual basis or otherwise, I wonder whether this does not present a real risk that it will be mainly the labour-intensive companies which will find themselves paying the CO2 tax.
refund	refund_nou	The auditors have rather found cases of technical irregularities, which normally result in a refund to the EU budget anyway, or a late payment, or incomplete paperwork which gets chased up later.
refund	refund_nou	I note that the report on the one-stop-shops and the refund of VAT generally was only referred to Parliament because of a change to the legal basis.
refund	refund_nou	If a refund is the only option available, compensation amounting to 50% of the ticket price will have to be paid.
refund	refund_nou	Moreover, appropriate legal proceedings have been initiated in order to obtain a refund for the costs incurred following the disaster.
refund	refund_nou	For all passengers, the right to a refund of the current price in the event of cancellation, overbooking or serious delay in the journey of at least two hours will now be a reality.
refund	refund_nou	I also propose an additional amendment at this stage that sectors where this is systematic should potentially be subject to a Commission-approved block exemption or refund.
refund	refund_vrb	This method is expensive, though, and not all countries refund the cost.
refund	refund_vrb	I am still hopeful that in the Council, the usual suspects who like to refund surpluses to the national ministries will make one more effort, so that next year at least, we have a more ambitious approach.
refund	refund_nou	But when prices began to slump again in late July, the Commission increased these refunds by 50 % and introduced the same refund rates for meat off the bone.
refund	refund_nou	For example, it is wrong to assume that if we abolish the refund for live cattle, third countries will import carcases rather than live animals.
refuse	None	If we now refuse this extension, the blame will mistakenly be laid at Parliament's door. That must not happen!
refuse	refuse_vrb	It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Let no one be in any doubt; I do not intend to give in to demagogy: my country' s government and local authorities are not responsible for the rains that fell, but they do have a responsibility from which they cannot shy away. They must show greater rigour in regional planning and greater resistance to urban speculation, they must refuse permission to build in areas at risk from flooding and establish better management of river beds and dam outlets.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Finally, I have made the point on a number of occasions that the right to refuse military service is still not recognized in all Member States.
refuse	refuse_vrb	For our part, we do not think so, and I refuse to sit back and do nothing.
refuse	refuse_vrb	I am generalising on purpose because I do not wish to point the finger at individual Member States that refuse to express their opinion on this important issue.
refuse	refuse_vrb	I refuse to see our older people working up to their death as we saw in the 19th century.
refuse	refuse_vrb	As far as environmental protection is concerned, I think that it is important for the European Union to refuse to import oil extracted from oil sands.
refuse	refuse_vrb	To those who look at structural unemployment problems in the European Union and who condemn the high levels of unemployment but who refuse to contemplate, through their votes in this House, a broadening of the tax base in areas such as energy, I would say: could they please tell us on the record where will we find the alternative resources to address the tax crisis in a number of states to do with structural problems and unemployment.
refuse	refuse_vrb	The European Union refuses to take account of the scientific studies, because it is obeying the orders of the monopoly business groups which refuse to sacrifice even a single euro of their profits for the health of workers and in-flight safety.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Is it the countries affected by famine who refuse to feed their people with potentially harmful products, or is it the countries who supply aid to deprived people only in the form of genetically modified seed, the consequences of which will be disastrous for the environment and for biodiversity?
refuse	refuse_vrb	In addition to this, they often refuse to open up a possible legal action in another Member State.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Member States and others refuse to face this reality and think that Europe, even if it has no money, should still be the driving force behind initiatives such as these.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Only those who refuse to recognise that among the peoples we represent no distinctions are made between the institutional bodies, could rejoice at the authority of any one of the three being undermined.
refuse	refuse_vrb	But, at the same time, I must ask you whether it is acceptable that any Council of Ministers can consistently refuse to uphold the rule of law and can ignore the judgments of the Court of First Instance.
refuse	refuse_vrb	It is his responsibility if he continues to refuse to participate in the negotiating delegation.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Even if you are unwilling to understand rational criticism of bourgeois society, you can - if you want to be bourgeois humanists, refuse to endorse these plans, for Europol's true nature is apparent from its areas of responsibility.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Implementing a clause to derogate from the weekly limit of 48 hours and not calculating on-call time as working time risks creating a two-speed social Europe, divided between workers who can benefit from social protection in their Member States and others who cannot refuse to accept diminished social rights.
refuse	refuse_vrb	To refuse to even prepare is to give Milosevic hope that there is, or may be, a better alternative for him.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Naturally, the EU must be able to refuse or remove this preferential treatment from countries that do not meet their commitments, but it is important to remember that we tread a fine line.
refuse	refuse_vrb	The Brazilian authorities have used their discretionary power within the law to refuse extradition of Mr Battisti.
refuse	refuse_vrb	I would remind colleagues that we have not been allowed to have an amendment under our Rules of Procedure to refuse to grant a definitive discharge.
refuse	refuse_vrb	On several other occasions in the past, Beijing has called on the Federal Government to refuse him entry.
refuse	refuse_vrb	The creation of a European type-approval system will help ensure that in future no Member State will be able, on grounds which relate to design features, to prohibit a vehicle manufacturer from offering it for sale, or to refuse its approval or use.
refuse	refuse_vrb	The exceptions are also clearly defined, and it is proposed that authorities should actively supply the public with information on the environment and that they should only be able to refuse to supply such information if disclosure might adversely affect private or public interests protected by the exceptions.
refuse	refuse_vrb	In Paris, as in Brussels and Strasbourg, we must refuse to occupy the ground chosen by Le Pen.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Secondly, Mr Putin is quite entitled to retain a degree of sovereignty over his country's energy resources and to refuse to sell them cut-price to hungry oil multinationals in the name of an economic liberalism to which he does not subscribe.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Retail networks may dictate their terms and refuse to accept for resale the produce of small producers.
refuse	refuse_vrb	The slow procedure and the quasi-monarchic nature of the regime that has been in power for almost 20 years, which, in particular, had led Madagascar' s government to refuse the presence of international observers, and the ambiguities found in the public statements made by the opposition, sow more than a seed of doubt as to whether these results are reliable.
refuse	refuse_vrb	How much longer, Mr President, honourable Members, will the governments of the European Union refuse to listen to the word on the street?
refuse	refuse_vrb	We refuse to cooperate for fundamental reasons with a government that has managed nonetheless to acquire Parliament' s support.
refuse	refuse_vrb	We utterly refuse to change the philosophy of it.
refuse	refuse_vrb	On the contrary, we refuse to be victims and are protagonists of our lives and our sexuality and it is we who decide on the type of society in which we want to live: a society able to tackle and put an end to discrimination, injustice, violence and the militarisation of states and minds.
refuse	refuse_vrb	Mr President, we refuse to endorse the draft directive which lays down the procedure for authorising genetically modified organisms, for fundamental reasons that I will set out in my explanation of vote, as well as for a very straightforward strategic reason.
refuse	refuse_vrb	I cannot make the Member States' technical staff go there, because they refuse to do so.
reject	reject_vrb	Madam President, although I support the first four amendments, I reject Amendment No 5.
reject	None	At the same time, two thirds of people in the Czech Republic consistently reject the foreign base, in spite of an information and promotional campaign that has been going on for more than two years.
reject	reject_vrb	The future role of genetic technology and biotechnology is still in dispute, and although we need to take account of people's concerns and fears, this does not mean that we should simply reject this vital field out of hand.
reject	NOne	This is the Middle East that we encourage to reject democracy, to reject the rule of law, and we continue to consider and propose a policy of impartiality for Israel.
reject	reject_vrb	But I do most positively reject any blanket discard ban as translating into yet another device of driving more of our fishermen out of business.
reject	reject_vrb	I am delighted that the Commissioner is with us because I would really like us to reject this new kind of blackmail using carbon emissions.
reject	reject_vrb	More than the budgetary realities, it is fear that Parliament's vote may be wrongly interpreted by the general public which leads the UPE Group to reject the entry of this ECU 100 million in the reserve.
reject	reject_vrb	Secondly, we must reject an extension of the scope to transport prevention actions.
reject	reject_vrb	It is unacceptable to the Parliament and I am pleased to support this motion to reject the deal as agreed and to start negotiations on making it better.
reject	reject_vrb	.  I was among the small number of Members who voted against the motion to reject the proposal for a directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.
reject	reject_vrb	We need to reject once and for all the misplaced belief that man has the dangers posed by nuclear energy under control.
reject	reject_vrb	We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the Commission and we shall help to develop the grass-roots fight to reject and overturn the anti-grass roots policies which the election of the new Commission marks with the 'blessing' of all the governments of the Member States.
reject	reject_vrb	Mr President, the Commission is obliged, for legal and institutional reasons, to reject all the amendments relating to the Tomlinson report.
reject	reject_vrb	Mr Bangemann, we must however reject the Commission's current policy of allowing the Member States to apply different aid systems since this leads to distortions of competition within the Community and even carries the risk that EU shipyards will fly the flag of another European Union country if, for example, the fiscal system is more attractive in the Netherlands than in another large Member State.
reject	reject_vrb	In the run-up to the plenary vote, I should like to urge you to reject the proposal on the said points, because those measures unnecessarily push up the costs for what are often small businesses.
reject	reject_vrb	I think that this behaviour is totally unacceptable and I now urge my fellow Members and the political groups to reject these amendments.
reject	reject_vrb	We must reject the proposal put forward by Finance Minister Waigel, that the rules be changed during the game and that special arrangements be applied to some countries, such as Italy and Belgium.
reject	reject_vrb	We need to reject this proposal first, though.
reject	reject_vrb	I do not believe that there is an easy way of choosing the applicable law in relation to divorce, but we could be clearer in terms of public policy and human rights in order to give the courts the powers of discretion to reject laws which are not in keeping with European customs, human rights and public policy.
reject	reject_vrb	We should reject this budget.
reject	reject_vrb	We should begin with what is already working successfully and not reject this, so that we do not get bogged down with a discussion only about own resources, and that we think, in fact, about how to construct the new financial framework.
reject	reject_vrb	This means we must reject, ignore and isolate the Belarus president from the rest of the world.
reject	reject_vrb	Nevertheless we find less than credible the much delayed decision by the Venezuelan National Electoral Council to reject 1.2 million out of 3 million signatures on the recall referendum; two in five signatures have actually been declared invalid.
reject	None	There is, however, another, even more important reason: we currently have no legal certainty as far as bans on movement at weekends are concerned and the countries - and I say this to those who wish to reject the proposal - which would like to strengthen this proposal unilaterally would expose themselves to legal proceedings and to possible appeals based solely on the principles of the freedom of movement and non-discrimination and which would most probably pose a threat to a number of existing bans, as well as to the regulation that is commonly known as the 'strawberry regulation' of 1998, which has recently been imposed on France in order to allow lorries to travel through the Mont Blanc tunnel.
reject	None	However, when majority opinion in seven Member States, including my own, opposes future enlargement, it is time to make the case to the public and confront those who seek to block progress; to reject those who even in this resolution seek to use language like ‘operational possibilities’ or ‘redrawing borders’ to undermine Europe’s existing commitments; to confront those like the British Conservatives who say that Europe has to choose between widening and deepening – we do not; to confront the far right who deliberately stoke fears that new migration threatens people’s jobs and livelihoods, when the evidence is just the opposite; to expose those who, even in this resolution again, welcome progress in Croatia, but not the very same progress in Turkey; to recognise that majority Muslim populations in Macedonia, Bosnia and Albania share a European destiny too; and to underline that a pause for reflection on the Constitutional Treaty cannot be an excuse to put a full stop on new enlargement.
reject	reject_vrb	We reject that view.
reject	reject_vrb	But we in UKIP reject Mr Barroso's plan for European integration because we know that individual Member States are not an irrelevance.
reject	reject_vrb	At the same time, we reject the arguments about competitiveness put forward by transport firms.
reject	reject_vrb	We also reject Amendment No 13, which proposes delaying the entry into force of certain elements of the Regulation by twelve months, since all of the security rules in the Regulation are based on rules approved by the ECAC, which all the States of the Union belong to.
reject	reject_vrb	A social Europe requires minimum standards, and so we reject the Commission’s amendments to the Working Time Directive, which suspend these standards and turn the directive into nothing but an arbitrary abstraction.
reject	reject_vrb	We also reject Mrs Haug's report for its proposals on the Union's special envoys.
reject	reject_vrb	We decidedly reject the artificial creation of a common EU cultural heritage at EU level.
reject	reject_vrb	That is unacceptable. It follows that we reject the result of the second round of the presidential elections.
reject	reject_vrb	We furthermore reject the preferential position proposed under paragraph 18 for religious communities in comparison with the rest of civil society.
reject	reject_vrb	This vision which we reject relies on empirical assumptions. Firstly, we disagree with the principle of women being a factor of peace and we reject this image of a dove superimposed on that of a woman to become as one.
reject	reject_vrb	We reject those amendments, put down by a number of colleagues, which we regard as last-ditch attempts to fragment the supposedly common market and protect national industries, especially in Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands.
reject	reject_vrb	We in the PPE Group reject the horizontal directive.
reject	reject_vrb	(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say to Mr Lambsdorff that I reject your accusation.
reject	reject_vrb	So I do reject the insult of this report.
reject	reject_vrb	I reject any categorisation of people based on usefulness criteria.
reject	reject_vrb	. Mr President, more than at any time in the Union’s history there is a disjunction between those who seek to move forward and those who wish to turn back; between those who defend the single market and the Lisbon Agenda as the best means to guarantee long-term efficiency, competitiveness and growth, and those who reject free trade in favour of economic patriotism akin – as Giulio Tremonti said – to that immediately before the 1914-18 war.
reject	reject_vrb	Those who 'steer' EU policy should realise, at long last, that the majority of citizens reject the Union as a militarist and neo-liberal project that is effectively antisocial!
reject	reject_vrb	Mr President, when we last debated this issue, I predicted that the Irish electorate would reject the political circus comprising Gerry Adams, Nigel Farage and Joe Higgins.
reject	reject_vrb	I cannot believe that if that amendment were rejected the PPE-DE Group would reject the whole package but I am assured by Mr Mann that would be the case.
reject	reject_vrb	Nor do we support the Fisheries Committee's decision to reject the legislative proposal concerning the regulation laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources (Izquierdo Rojo report).
reject	reject_vrb	"Mrs Napoletano's report asks for a ""European urban strategy' which forms part of an integrated and therefore federalist policy of spatial planning, a Jacobean step which we can only reject."
resume	resume_vrb	I am happy to resume my own responsibilities, but if the President wishes to speak, he is welcome.
resume	resume_vrb	Nonetheless, it is imperative to overcome the stalemate the Development Round finds itself in following Cancún. Work on the basis of the agreements previously reached must resume at the earliest opportunity.
resume	resume_vrb	Ladies and gentlemen, we shall adjourn the debate on the budget which will resume this evening at 9 p.m.
resume	resume_vrb	Lastly, President Gbagbo must resume dialogue in order to pursue an unqualified and unambiguous effort to achieve national reconciliation, which is essential for a country that has been torn apart for many years by the manipulation of the concept of Ivorian birthright, almost 30% of whose population is made up of foreigners.
resume	resume_vrb	If Hamas recognises Israel, continues to observe the ceasefire and does not resume violence; and if Israel engages in easing the many restrictions, guarantees real rights of defence to the hundreds of Palestinians held in administrative detention, and refrains from holding people indefinitely in such detention, both the new Palestinian and the future Israeli Governments might find themselves somehow able to work together, if only to keep life going.
resume	resume_vrb	It will resume at 9 p.m.
resume	resume_vrb	I am very sorry about this but we are going to have to stop the debate at this point and resume it at 9 o'clock this evening.
resume	resume_vrb	Since it is time to resume the sitting, there will be no suspension.
resume	resume_vrb	It is important for us to resume the negotiations on this dossier and to achieve a result by the specified deadline.
resume	resume_vrb	It was then that I was able to resume talks with the Commission and the Finnish Presidency of the Council.
resume	resume_vrb	My objective is to have the additional measures in place by the summer so that we can resume payments in the autumn.
resume	resume_vrb	But let us first see if the President will respect his promises to return to normal rule and resume the reform process as soon as possible.
resume	resume_vrb	The European Union welcomes the decision by the Democratic People' s Republic to resume its reporting under the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights during the year 2000 and hopes that the country will now, on the basis of its own report, be able to enter into a useful and constructive dialogue with the UN Human Rights Committee
resume	resume_vrb	It is indeed welcome of course that the interinstitutional trauma of the last few months is now drawing to a close and good that normal business is about to resume.
resume	resume_vrb	In the past months, Ecuador has also indicated officially that it is ready to resume negotiations and join the multilateral agreement.
resume	resume_vrb	If a debate needs to stop and resume after Question Time finishes, so be it.
resume	resume_vrb	Unfortunately, Iran has not yet accepted our offer to resume bilateral dialogue about human rights.
resume	resume_vrb	Welcomes the Council decision of 18 June asking the EU to resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately and to this end to develop the conditions for urgent, practical and financial assistance, including direct financial support to the new government, as well as to ensure the provision of emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza;'
resume	resume_vrb	I therefore feel obliged to schedule the vote for 3 p.m. and resume our debate.
resume	resume_vrb	It is regrettable that the process of multilateral disarmament has been interrupted and that there has been no political will to resume it for several years.
resume	resume_vrb	Faced with this spiral of violence, we call on the Indonesian Government and the pro-independence movement to resume negotiations in order to implement the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.
resume	resume_vrb	We shall resume at noon for the voting.
resume	resume_vrb	It is important that the Foundation should resume its work of promoting democracy and development, and this must be implemented.
resume	resume_vrb	As it is now time for the votes, we shall suspend the joint debate and it shall resume at 3 p.m.
resume	resume_vrb	All this must be an essential prerequisite if the Union is to resume the financing which is absolutely vital for the reconstruction of the country' s war-torn economy and for its development.
resume	resume_vrb	As you know, this has led to the postponement of meetings of the Union for the Mediterranean, but the Presidency believes that regional cooperation and dialogue is the way to achieve peace, build confidence and create prosperity and we certainly expect to resume work within the Union for the Mediterranean as soon as possible.
resume	resume_vrb	Now comes the test of whether a genuine will to change and to resume relations with the EU lies behind the readiness to engage in dialogue.
resume	resume_vrb	But I call on the UK Government to do all they can to persuade Zimbabwe to set up an independent arbitration board fully representative of the landless people and, once it is set up, perhaps with the assistance of the Commonwealth, to resume financial aid as soon as possible.
resume	resume_vrb	The European Union will help the Lebanese to rebuild their destroyed country and to get back on their feet and resume normal life and, in this connection, our humanitarian and emergency aid is vital.
retard	retard_vrb	These diseases cause not only human suffering and an extremely high number of deaths, which are in themselves justification enough for such a response, but also cause a drastic reduction in life expectancy and in the labour force, with all the social and economic consequences that this entails They seriously disable large working populations, retard social and economic development and destabilise communities that are already weakened.
retard	retard_vrb	Nor are women given the same access as men to health care and to medicines that retard the progress of the disease.
retard	retard_vrb	Their real concern is not about human rights. It is that the accession of a populous, proud and assertive Muslim country would retard their dream of a federation, of a country called Europe.
retard	retard_vrb	We voted against CCCTB, but we did not vote against the entire report because we did not want to retard the sort of support that is needed for SMEs, and I am glad of the opportunity to put that on record.
retard	retard_vrb	And, thanks to your courage and determination, Prime Minister, Europe's bigger Member States can only retard rapid progress for so long.
retard	retard_vrb	Then we have tried to salve our consciences by massive aid programmes which have not served to ameliorate the conditions of those countries but, on the contrary, by breaking the distinction between representation and taxation, have served to retard democratic development across much of the world.
sake	sake	I therefore ask you, for the sake of the European Union and the difficult tasks that lie before us, to make this distinction whenever possible.
sake	sake	Meanwhile, for the sake of the Community in all its parts, I believe that we must make progress with the implementation of the transEuropean transport network.
sake	sake	All hypocrisy aside, I believe that it is important to emphasise this because, as has been said, the fisheries sector has a fundamental role to play if we want to ensure that our fishermen do not keep reducing their catch capacity because we have forced them to do so for the sake of our seas.
sake	sake	We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers.
sake	sake	They talk of fear, a police state, repressions, hunger, poverty, regression, as we just heard and so forth. Bulgaria's reputation is being tarnished for the sake of short-term political gains.
sake	sake	The junta's statement that Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for the sake of her own safety is an insult to the intelligence of any thinking person, and I entirely agree with Mrs McKenna that we must immediately demand to know where she is, and obtain access to her.
sake	sake	I know, however, that, merely for the sake of the NGOs, it is important that in questions of labour standards and minimum standards we should be able to make progress, so that the next round of WTO negotiations acquires sufficient approval and credibility.
sake	sake	For the sake of balancing the budget, which is the alibi used for constant cuts in social spending and the privatisation of public utilities, big business is being empowered and called on to complete the dismantling of insurance and pension systems.
sake	sake	I do not know if the Dutch would like the canals of Amsterdam to become open sewers for the sake of competitiveness.
sake	sake	Agricultural policy-makers and farmers have repeatedly proved their willingness to make sacrifices and accept change for the sake of a European community.
sake	sake	If we really do act upon it, we may not, we cannot, disregard human rights and respect for human dignity for the sake of of any kind.
sake	sake	I am therefore in favour of opening negotiations for the sake of the security of Europe’s citizens; for the sake of peace; for the sake of the fight against terrorism, which, to be effective, must also include political decisions to isolate terrorists; and for the sake of the strength of Europe as a model of democracy that exports democratic values.
sake	sake	We do not need to have a summit for the sake of it.
sake	None	However, for consistency' s sake and with regard to the framework directive which is the basis of this whole legislative approach, I cannot accept the others at present.
sake	sake	Mrs Malmström has indicated this, and I am convinced that the Hungarian Presidency will be a partner in this matter in the following term, since Hungary, as a neighbour of Serbia, has an important stake in the resolution of these problems for the sake of good neighbourly relations, as well as the community of 300 000 Hungarians living in Serbia.
sake	sake	For the sake of clarity, for the sake of simplicity and for the sake of legal certainty, we believe that instead of this legislation, which is spread across several legal texts, instead of this situation, a specific directive would be better.
sake	sake	Let me say, for Mr Poettering’s information, for the sake of absolute clarity and the avoidance of doubt, that we, in this group, hope that 3 October will see the opening of negotiations not only with Turkey but also with Croatia.
sake	sake	There will be one or two small technical points that I would like to bring up tomorrow as oral amendments, just to clarify the text and for the sake of linguistic consistency.
sake	sake	For the sake of fair treatment of the areas subject to the statistical effect in relation to the traditional Objective 1 regions, there must be no further budget cuts or dilution of support.
separate	separate_adj	Although the European Union has co-funded in Ceuta aquaculture activities and has started up a fish farm with genuine success, we think that it should also use - as a tool for boosting the economy and creating jobs- since there is a market - the possibility of adopting customs measures since Ceuta, although a part of a European Union Member State has a separate customs system; especially bearing in mind that extending the quota proposed in this report, together with the REX Committee's own amendments, would not distort the Community sea bream and sea bass market, as these are the products concerned and which enjoy full and growing demand.
separate	separate_adj	Let me clarify that by pointing out that copyright is a separate and different right from patents.
separate	separate_adj	I am pleased that Commissioner Dalli promised that there will be a new, separate draft on cloning and the subject of cloned products soon.

separate	separate_adj	In order to make the situation simpler, more transparent and consistent with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty, I propose that the Supply Agency have its own budget line which will be separate from the budget of the Commission departments and in which administrative expenditure will be clearly separated from the Agency's operational expenditure.
separate	separate_adj	I should like to put on record that my involvement with the Danish referendum has been entirely separate from my work in this House and that I have never infringed any parliamentary rules.

separate	separate_adj	It is separate from the context of the privileges and immunities of other servants of the Union, and must not be allowed to fragment into the preferences of each Member State.
separate	None	What we now need, ahead of the forthcoming enlargement and in the light of ongoing changes to the international order, is to separate the constitutional framework, namely the first and second parts of the constitutional treaty, from the common policies in the third part.
separate	separate_vrb	The Olympic flag and the sacred flame of ancient Olympia will hold the ideal position among the things that separate us, but also, above all, among the things that unite us.
separate	separate_vrb	At the same time, the large distances which as a rule separate those areas from urban centres, their particularly difficult climatic conditions, the lack of infrastructure and appropriate technical support, and their inadequate and inappropriate road network, lead to isolation and restrict the potential for making the most of local products and for the proper operation of local markets, for the development of new economic activities, for the maintenance of satisfactory health levels, for education and for cultural activity.
separate	separate_adj	Programmes such as 'Youth in Action' and 'Lifelong Learning', which have a very low cost per beneficiary and are extremely effective, should therefore be maintained as a separate element of future multiannual financial frameworks, and these programmes also deserve significantly more funding.
separate	separate_adj	(IT) Madam President, I should like to ask, on behalf of the ALDE Group, whether a separate vote is possible on paragraph 42.
separate	separate_adj	We have requested a separate vote on Amendments 25 and 27, and we call on all colleagues in the two big groups to vote against those amendments and support the position of the Commission to phase out the support by 2014.
separate	separate_adj	The example the speaker from Great Britain presented concerning doctors is evidence of the need for separate treatment.
separate	separate_adj	The Commission will provide separate notification of the guidelines on aid to environmental protection next year and, in this context, equal innovation will get my full attention.
separate	separate_adj	Secondly, transport workers: when we already have tachograph legislation in place, why do we need to bring in a separate and new directive on transport workers, in particular lorry drivers and so on?
separate	separate_adj	As regards the recent protests against the results of the Moldovan elections, my group has submitted a separate resolution which diverges from the compromise reached by the four groups.
separate	separate_adj	That is a separate question but I can assure the Member that Ireland has not experienced any difficulties in this regard.
separate	separate_adj	Yet we seem unable to accept the rights of the Turkish population of Cyprus to be accorded their rights to a separate administration and indeed, if this cannot be achieved, the right to secede from the Republic of Cyprus and follow a path of self determination as far from the smallest country in the world.
separate	separate_adj	On Amendment 3 regarding discard reduction, I have been working on a separate initiative.

sow	sow	Mr President, as regards the challenges which the fundamentalists have presented us with, we must congratulate the rapporteur on the frame of mind which prevailed in the drawing up of this report.

sow	sow	For this reason, I also believe that the European Union has the task of addressing the root causes which sow the emotional seeds of terrorism, whether it be in the Middle East, in the relations between Pakistan and India, or in other parts of the world where we should make a particular effort to make our contribution to securing peace.

sow	sow	And along come interested parties now and look at this creation, at the way in which the farming community has been able, as a matter of course, to develop and sow seed, to breed and rear animals and to feed us with the fruits of its labour, and these interested parties decide they would like a slice of the cake.
sow	sow	From now on, we should first reflect the facts properly and more broadly, and write only afterwards. We must be very serious in our conclusions, for we shall surely reap what we sow.
sow	sow	In terms of reaping what we sow, our capitalist intentions will lead, for the vast majority of humanity, to price increases, unemployment, poverty, hunger and so on.

sow	sow	With regard to land-based food chains, we have to sow and breed as well as harvest and process.
sow	sow	We call on President Bush to take the desire of our peoples for peace seriously and not to sow dissent in the international coalition against terrorism, and therefore to fight together for a peaceful and a more stable world.
sow	sow	After supporting the Commission's position, which it considers to be crucial to a food quality policy and to combat any attempt to sow confusion amongst consumers, when discussing Protected Designations of Origins (PDOs) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGIs), the report overlooks some contradictions and tables some amendments that give rise to doubts.
sow	sow	Even though there is room for improvement in this or that area, the European Union - and the national parliaments, the European Parliament, the governments and the Commission are all part of the Union - must stand together and send a clear signal that we are too firmly committed to human rights to let anyone sow division among us.
sow	sow	It strengthens farms' liquidity, enabling them to buy in feedingstuffs and sow new crops.
sow	sow	I congratulate Karl von Wogau, the Commission and the Council and I hope that in Barcelona we will be able to reap the harvest which we have begun to sow today.

subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	People must realise that the European Parliament is not subordinate to the Council.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	I have spoken with both candidates and I have told them: rather than arguing about how Congolese you are and about all these subordinate issues which, at base, only concern your own personal interests, it would perhaps be more worthwhile to tell the Congolese how you plan to give them better access to education, justice, health, administration, culture and infrastructures; and also how you are, for example, to implement an embryonic social security system with the help of the international community.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	And it must do so within a system of international cooperation, particularly with the United States and with Russia, who are pioneers in terms of space, and also with others such as Japan, China, etc. But that cooperation cannot be subordinate.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	Women were seen to have an inferior, subordinate role.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	Presenting the fact that the salary and allowance regime is different from that of national MPs as a privilege, while disregarding the fact that that was the one single condition preventing a Member of the European Parliament from being considered to carry out a hierarchically subordinate role to that of a member of a national parliament, is not, in my opinion, satisfactory.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	I therefore believe that the most important thing in devising this strategy is to establish this concept, to which the lists of rights must be subordinate, as they are not always reasonable, achievable or appropriate.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	It is reminiscent of a Tsar’s visit to a subordinate province.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	Security is not subordinate to freedom, nor is it a threat to freedom.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	Mr President-in-Office, I regret that I have to end this speech, but I would like to conclude by stating that it is very unfortunate that the European Union and its institutions have become subordinate to the decisions of a military organisation and relinquished their political responsibility in Europe for so many years.

subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	Surely it cannot be our intention to render everything subordinate to the one paradigm, which is to be disseminated from Seattle to the rest of the world?
subordinate	subordinate_vrb	Finally, once we have adopted this directive in one form or another, I very much hope that, regardless of the crisis, the Member States will nonetheless not subordinate the short-term situation to long-term goals.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	In order to safeguard their interests, the Commission should consult with individual Member States and the officials and representatives of the various national assessment bodies, in order to ensure that specific individual needs are not subordinate to Community interests.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	The fact of the matter is that in a modern democratic state, the state security corps and the military have to be subordinate to the civilian power - that is the definition of a modern democratic state.
subordinate	subordinate_adj-nou	If this goal is to be achieved, though, all the administrative units must be modernised; not just the Commission’s main offices, but also the subordinate offices, the agencies, and I can also see that the establishment, organisation and control of these is flourishing unchecked.

supplement	None	In this context I should like to highlight some of the changes taken up by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development concerning the regions that I know best, the Azores and Madeira. For instance: the eligibility of traditional varieties for the purposes of vineyard restructuring, including premiums for the grubbing-up of those varieties; maintenance of the supplement to the special premium for the fattening of bovine animals, so as to encourage farmers who have no more milk quota to change over to beef and ensure that the added value of fattening does not leave the region in the form of very young cattle for export; the flexibility of granting aid for the marketing of plants and flowers without the need to draw up annual contracts with producers' organisations, which would be impossible in view of the inadequate organisation of agriculture in these regions; the extension of aid to the marketing of potatoes for human consumption; the increase in production rights and premiums for strategic productions, such as suckler cows, bovine animals for fattening, or sugar beet; improvement of the special supply arrangement with the inclusion of certain raw materials essential for the competitiveness of the compound feedingstuff production sector and consequently for the livestock sector.
supplement	supplement_nou	With regard to food supplement labelling, the proposal for a directive provides for clear consumer information.

supplement	supplement_vrb	(FR) The strategy developed in the excellent Barnier report with a view to making the most of the very considerable efforts made by Europeans in the field of emergency aid could supplement the Community civil protection mechanism instituted in 2001, whether the crisis were internal or external to the EU.
supplement	supplement_vrb	General practitioners, through the daily and direct relationship that they have with patients, could be a valuable resource for identifying alcohol-related problems even before patients themselves become aware of them: a simple questionnaire, known as an audit, which is already being tried out in some European cities, could supplement such personal action.

supplement	supplement_vrb	The second aspect is the benefit of having a virtual mobility system to supplement geographical mobility.
supplement	supplement_vrb	The new legislative act should supplement and strengthen the Member States' efforts to improve the present situation, imposing lines of conduct at a European level, by taking into account the progress in medicine.
supplement	supplement_vrb	The Treaty now contains a new Title which provides a basis for the Union to take action to boost and supplement the Member States' own policies, and together the Member States and the Union are sure to be able to pursue a more effective and, above all, a coordinated policy.
supplement	supplement_vrb	Its purpose is to encourage high-quality, general education by supporting cooperation, strengthening mobility and developing the European dimension in all spheres of education. This will supplement the actions of the Member States in this area.
supplement	supplement_vrb	I congratulate the report because, apart from the fact that it draws attention to the obstacles preventing freedom of movement on the labour market for workers from the new Member States, it also includes important elements to supplement the European Job Mobility Action Plan presented by the European Commission, such as support for programmes which correlate the education system with the labour market, reciprocal recognition of qualifications and extending the EURES network.
supplement	None	in writing. - (DE) The Agreement between the EU and Canada on civil aviation safety, which is a supplement to the Air Transport Agreement with Canada, is intended to remove technical trade barriers.

supplement	supplement_nou	It is, after all, a supplement to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which dates back to 1959.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect, however, that few Members of this House would be prepared to vote in favour of closing our borders to tobacco from the United States.
suspect	suspect_vrb	Experts should be in a position to suspect that the information on emissions they are examining has been compiled using a very different scale or measurement procedure from the figure to which they are attempting to relate the information.
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	Added to this is the fact that we are for the first time faced with a situation in which the start-up of a suspect nuclear plant may well be part of an election strategy.
suspect	None	I suspect that had that process been discovered in Scandinavia in 1998, it would have been viewed as best available technology, plastic packaging would have been banned and cellophane would have been used instead.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect, Prime Minister, that as the man in the middle, you share some of that dismay.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect the Commission might wish to do that as well, because it is a problem which rightly, in this amendment, relates to interinstitutional matters.
suspect	suspect_vrb	The budget is a strong one, but it has to be said that under one Heading, which mentions the European Union as a global partner, that is, point 134, I suspect that I voted wrongly, because I was following the group list and I do not agree with it in all respects.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect that Mr Sarkozy would describe himself, following this experience of the financial crisis, as a Keynesian.
suspect	suspect_vrb	But for quick and easy reference, I draw his attention to the set of tables that he will have in his office today or at the very latest tomorrow - I suspect that they are there today - which will give him complete and up-to-date details on each of the aspects of reform relating to the establishment, development and operation, for instance, of the internal audit service.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect that European citizens will not be pleased with such an approach, because it means that one year before elections to the European Parliament we can only offer them three points in these conclusions.
suspect	suspect_vrb	From this morning's speech, I suspect that your nerves are as steely as those of the Portuguese football team.
suspect	None	Ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I suspect the annual report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy for 2008 will not arouse such emotion as will our debate on the subject next year.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect that it is the intention to vote all these paragraphs out.
suspect	suspect_vrb	However, the ubiquitous Dr Rath - wherever he is, and I suspect he is in this House - has carefully changed the message regularly as it comes through, making it very difficult for our services to block these e-mails.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect, Mr President-in-Office, that we lack courage to tackle this major problem.
suspect	suspect_vrb	Mr President, on past performance, I suspect that the Council will be an occasion when British red lines will become pink smudges, later to be rubbed out entirely by the federalising European Court of Justice.
suspect	suspect_vrb	Today, I suspect that there are possibly one or two Member States - perhaps one of them is your own, Mr Wurtz - who might have similar interests, the same sort of interests that you most strongly condemn where the US is concerned.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect that, for our generation, it was almost as important a document in shaping our attitudes as any by the great political philosophers.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I must say, quite frankly, that I did not encounter much enthusiasm, mainly because some people suspect - or fear - that this freedom being granted to Member States, regions and private operators might just be hiding certain pitfalls.
suspect	suspect_vrb	In paragraph 19, for example, we are, I think, directly intervening in Iran's internal affairs, given the past pattern, the lack of faith in even in the most straightforward people in Iran, who look at the United States, Great Britain and the European Union and suspect that they are about to come and impose their control again.
suspect	suspect_vrb	There is real tension between the countries in the North, which are denouncing the social and environmental dumping practised by emerging countries, and the countries in the South, which suspect the North of wanting to impede their economic development and, through the implementation of these standards, to exercise a form of disguised protectionism.
suspect	suspect_vrb	– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that anyone could suspect our group or me personally of being opposed to a debate on Chechnya.

suspect	suspect_vrb	If we go down the route of denying basic human rights and basic democratic rights to those we suspect of terror, then we are giving them a victory and we are shaping a society which in the long run will not be in the best interests of the people of this world who want to live in a sustainable peace.
suspect	suspect_vrb	Is it because we suspect some fraud or irregularity?
suspect	suspect_vrb	Mr President, I should like to make two brief points which may well be relevant should this go to conciliation, as I suspect it will.
suspect	suspect_vrb	I suspect that shortly we will be able to reach a view about the particular sector to which she refers.
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	I would like to notify you that this morning a suspect package was found near the Louise Weiss Building and that the French police, in collaboration with our security services, denied access to the building and carried out a test which, fortunately, proved to be negative.
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	Furthermore, what about the new law in Russia regarding the practice whereby a suspect is not handed over for questioning in the country in which the crime has occurred?
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	In their conclusions about limiting salmon consumption, the study's authors appear, as Mrs Stihler said, to have misapplied an already suspect risk model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency by failing to include any analysis of the health benefits of eating salmon, despite over 5 000 scientific papers attesting to the necessity of eating oil-rich fish as a regular component of a balanced diet.
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	The bankruptcy law could also play a key role: the principle and the ‘suspect period’ should also play a role in both extraordinary administration and controlled administration.
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	The actions of the European Union in the field of human rights are clearly perceived by part of the international community, for some reason, as being suspect.
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	The differences are important: two of these States have a Christian tradition and a European culture; some have got rid of their former communist masters while others have kept them on in re-incarnated forms, following elections that have sometimes been suspect.
suspect	suspect_adj-nou	Of the Commission' s nine proposals, we think that five are suspect for one reason or another.
syndicate	syndicate_nou	The person who guaranteed those office blocks, and as appeared subsequently, her own private dwelling as well, has once again been arrested on suspicion of being the financial brain behind a very violent criminal syndicate that has been known to murder people.
syndicate	syndicate_nou	Is that situation the fault of Laval, or is it the fault of a syndicate which puts protecting Swedish jobs ahead of the common market principles we have signed up to?
syndicate	syndicate_nou	But they cannot be, as they often are, the exclusive preserve of a self-elected technocracy, a syndicate of civil servants or, worse still, the coalition of political parties.
syndicate	syndicate_nou	If we stop, the ‘no’ syndicate will say that it has won and that is a risk we cannot accept.
syndicate	syndicate_nou	I would even go as far as to say that it is a crisis borne of the Member States' obsessive belief that they can solve Europe's problems with their intergovernmental approach, when a monetary area, Mr President, must be governed by a single method, by the Community method, on the basis of the European interest, and not by a syndicate of national interests, which is what the European Council and the Council of the European Union, by their very nature, represent.
syndicate	syndicate_nou	This was highlighted not only by the Slovak Syndicate of Journalists but also by the OSCE; the latter even vigorously appealed to the Parliament to reject the controversial proposal.
syndicate	syndicate_nou	One possibility would also be to set up a syndicate to administer the flow of gas through Ukraine: that would be a quick and urgent measure.
syndicate	None	The report's cynical confessions reveal the role and imperialist intentions of the EU and confirm once again that 'the EU and NATO are both part of the same homicidal syndicate'.

tear	tear_vrb	Tear up this proposal and allow us to vote on each report separately and to vote on the amendments tabled.
tear	tear_vrb	Sadly, the approach was not integrated and the Framework Directive is used as a tear-off calendar by those working in water management.
tear	tear_vrb	Mr President, Commissioner, I note that a lot of the speeches here have been by Dutch speakers, but that is perhaps no coincidence, as there is a hit song in the Low Countries that goes something like this: 'I tear through the Brenner Pass in my 30-tonne diesel lorry, far from home but on top of the world'.
tear	tear_vrb	A week later, a wolf really came and started to tear the sheep to pieces.
tear	tear_vrb	We must do more to tear down barriers.

tear	tear_nou	Dostoyevsky said: ‘No world event is worth the shedding of one child’s tear’.
tear	None	Rather than striving towards settlement or peace with the Jewish state, we should tear out its page from history, for that is what Khomeini called for, and, according to the present Iranian President Ahmadinejad, those are words of wisdom.
tear	None	When the last generation saw Nelson Mandela labelled a terrorist, when former East Germans smuggled themselves across the Berlin Wall, when the Holocaust represented one of the worst ethnic genocides in world history, the threats of terrorism, trafficking and racial hatred were a cue to agree human rights, not to tear them down.
tear	tear_vrb	We must ask the Irish presidency to tear up its original plans and timetable for its presidency and focus first and foremost on this.
tear	tear_vrb	This implies that some would like to be able to undermine the influence of labour law and the employee and tear up welfare policy, etc without the EU' s interfering.
tear	tear_vrb	I am also surprised that you are surprised that this is the sort of thing that happens when you tear down all the border controls.
tear	tear_vrb	We are, however, all agreed that, as the Commissioner so wisely said, there is no need to tear up existing legislation on public procurement.
tear	None	They pay neither for the additional wear and tear caused by heavy vehicles nor for the environmental damage caused by vehicle emissions.
transform	transform	Consumers are entitled, therefore, to speculate on the true motives of the Commission, a Commission that is desperately trying to transform a distribution system which, everyone agrees, has not only proven its worth but has also respected the main principles of competition.

transform	transform	Attempts - and now it is a question of more than mere attempts - to compare Zionism with racism, as at the Durban Conference and, therefore, to transform the Israeli-Arab conflict into a racial and religious conflict, when in fact it is a political conflict requiring a political solution, will certainly not have helped matters.

transform	transform	There are various types of responsibility, and I think that, with this decision, Ariel Sharon did not just kill a leader, something that – for heaven’s sake – I as a woman regard as the utmost in evil, but his intention was in fact to transform a national conflict into a religious conflict.
transform	transform	We shall therefore cultivate the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, to which we shall devote a large number of economic, cultural and social initiatives - including a Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations - and we shall cultivate the project to transform the financial facility currently operating within the EIB into an autonomous body, in other words a genuine Mediterranean Bank.
transform	transform	A question of this importance, for the preservation of identities and for normalizing transnational communication and the efficiency of the European institutions, cannot be left to the will of certain Member States that might just be tempted to transform their interests into acquired rights given the void in terms of Community policy.
transform	transform	(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Cappato has proposed, and achieved, with this report is to make it known that the European Parliament is in favour of experiments to transform the production of opium in Afghanistan for criminal uses into the production of opium for medicinal uses to treat patients.
transform	transform	You need to follow these deliberations through, transform the General Affairs Council into a purely Foreign Affairs and Defence Council, and set up a body to coordinate with senior ministers meeting once a week.
transform	transform	Allow me to quote a few that have been at the heart of the agenda for the Commission of which I am President: the internal energy market, maritime security, measures to strengthen the regulation and supervision of financial markets, and the EUR 5 billion package of recovery measures to transform Europe into a sustainable economy.
transform	transform	This period of crisis and rescue plans may be the worst possible time for starting negotiations on the financial perspective, but for all those of us who believe in the EU budget as an instrument needed to transform 27 Member States into a true Union, the challenge is before us, and our sights must be set high enough to tackle it.
transform	transform	We should therefore welcome the ambitious attempts to reform the Commission and to transform it into the Human Rights Council, whose work will be more independent.
transform	transform	Thirty years of difficult negotiations, exemptions and exceptions, a legal basis that only serves to give illegitimate powers to the Commission in Brussels, an attempt to transform a directive into a regulation using an implementation group.
transform	transform	It should be addressed both to the organising committee and to UEFA, spelling out our concern over the danger threatening to transform a sporting event into uncontrolled entertainment with women as its victims.
transform	transform	We believe that it is also very well situated to confront relations between the European Union and United States, and in order to try to somehow transform the discord of the past into the harmony of the present and future.
transform	transform	This will transform the lives of older people, people with disabilities and parents with children living in towns across the North-West who will now be able to use local buses as easily as everybody else.
transform	transform	This will not only transform the lives of many people with disabilities who will now be encouraged to play as full a role in society as everyone else, but it will also transform the economy of the European Union and make it truly the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world based on greater social cohesion.
transform	transform	Such a development would alter the nature of collective negotiations, ignore the role of the interrelation of forces in determining the contents of collective agreements and, finally, transform trade unions into mere enforcers of government decisions.
transform	transform	I say 'yes', so that Europe can tackle the present-day challenges - I am thinking in particular of climate change - that will radically transform our lives.
transplant	transplant_nou	Mortality rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15% to 30%.
transplant	transplant_nou	The Commission and the Member States must take measures to combat transplant tourism and the illegal trade in organs more effectively.
transplant	transplant_nou	in writing. - The need for greater cooperation across Member States is essential if we are to help EU citizens who require an organ transplant.
transplant	transplant_nou	Whilst this situation, which has tragic consequences for people who are waiting for an organ transplant, may be one of the causes of organ trafficking, it is not the only one.
transplant	transplant_nou	We must address the underlying causes of this criminality: the severe shortage of organs available for transplant, which is due in no small part to a lack of public information.
transplant	transplant_nou	Removing organs and carrying out the transplant, along with post-transplant care, are expensive medical procedures, but every Member State must make efforts to encourage this type of medical procedure.
transplant	transplant_nou	Every day, 12 people die in Europe because they have not received a transplant in time, and 60 000 people are currently waiting for a transplant.
transplant	transplant_nou	All of this forms the basis for optimising what we could call a harmonised European transplant system shared by all the Member States as an instrument for achieving the objective that we have set ourselves. Our objective is simply to reach the point where no European dies because he lacks an organ that he needs in order to live due to systems that have not been perfected.
transplant	transplant_nou	For example a transplant could be allowed from one HIV-positive patient to other.
transplant	transplant_nou	There is no doubt that we need to offer clear and efficient channels of support for the European public so that no European dies due to a lack of organs as a result of shortcomings in the transplant system.
transplant	transplant_nou	With this report, we have given the opportunity of a better quality of life to those people - more than 56 000 European Union residents - who are currently waiting for an organ transplant.
transplant	transplant_nou	The disgraceful but particularly profitable 'transplant tourism' which is developing illustrates the intensity and the extent of the problem and provides clear proof of the link between this huge crime and the legal activities of big business, of the exploitation of the less developed countries and their peoples in particular.
transplant	transplant_nou	"This rise in so-called ""transplant tourism"", whereby rich EU citizens, rich EU patients, are purchasing organs from living donors in developing countries, is on the rise and is to me completely abhorrent."
transplant	transplant_nou	The figures speak for themselves. Approximately 60 000 patients are on a waiting list for a transplant in the Member States of the EU.
transplant	transplant_nou	Such cooperation can improve transplant services across Europe, ensuring improved access to donated organs on a non-commercial basis.
transplant	transplant_nou	I would especially like to underline the role of the transplant coordinator or coordination team, the importance of which is beyond question.
transplant	transplant_nou	Member of the Commission. - Madam President, 56 000 Europeans are waiting for an organ transplant in Europe; for many of these people, a successful transplant is a matter of life and death.
transplant	transplant_nou	Although the organ shortage remains the biggest challenge facing us at the moment, there are far more difficulties related to the different transplant systems which are used in Member States.
transplant	transplant_nou	As previously explained, donation and transplant procedures rely on solidarity. They rely on people playing their part in the donation system in an altruistic and disinterested way.
transplant	transform	Firstly, we are establishing an EU framework to give Europeans equal access to health in general and to transplant treatment in particular.
transplant	None	For that reason, a few other Members and I have also invited an expert who has investigated organ trading and the deliberate killing of people in China for organs to transplant to come and speak to us tomorrow.
transplant	None	These authorities will be responsible for ensuring the quality and the safety of the organs 'throughout the entire chain, from donation to transplant, as well as in evaluating the quality and safety during the recovery and subsequent monitoring of the respective patient'.
transplant	transplant_nou	Parliament's proposed measures to encourage debate on organ donation, on national transplant hotlines, positive media exposure for organ donation and educating sports stars may possibly be justified, but these initiatives must be decided by the Member States themselves on the basis of the prevailing social climate in the respective country.
transplant	transplant_nou	Achieving that depends, however, on transplant laws that provide in principle for the removal of organs after death, unless the person concerned has left instructions to the contrary.
transplant	transplant_nou	It is also due to the work begun in 1986 with the creation of the regional transplant coordination system: another example of how the regions can make their contribution to Europe.
transplant	None	I myself believe, although you cannot automatically transplant one human rights situation to another country and each situation must reflect national differences, that even when improvements are very slow to come one must show a certain circumspection when considering breaking off economic relations which have been built up slowly and which are aimed first and foremost at improving the social and economic development of the people in a country such as Vietnam.
transport	transport_vrb	We need to be able to transport all the goods necessary for the functioning of our economies all over Europe, while at the same time keeping our fellow citizens as safe as possible and continually ensuring that we protect our environment.
transport	transport_vrb	"What about the small-scale farmer who simply wants to transport his animals from A to B? What about the village butcher; are we not always saying ""yes' to local produce?"
transport	transport_nou	While ensuring these sensitive procedures for an infinitely small sector of goods transport we must not, however, forget those for which procedures must be simple and practical.
transport	transport_nou	The interests of the European maritime transport sector must therefore be assigned high priority in establishing general European transport policy.
transport	transport_nou	We ask the Commission to draw up an appropriate, cross-sectoral strategy to facilitate implementation of intelligent transport systems.
transport	transport_nou	Yesterday in my discussion dossier for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I came across a study on illegal immigrants at sea, the actions proposed in which should be implemented as a matter of priority.
transport	transport_nou	Indeed, the Commission has already requested the Committee to rule on the slaughter and transport of farmed fish.
transport	transport_nou	If we look at the transport trend in recent years, it becomes very clear that inland waterways are becoming increasingly important.
transport	transport_nou	In this respect, road charges constitute a financial impulse mechanism that must contribute to the improvement of transport links in the enlarged Union.
transport	transport_nou	By critical situation, I am referring to the situation of land transport, Trans-European Networks, sea transport, air transport and transport safety in general.
transport	transport_nou	Ladies and gentlemen, during 2001 we are going to continue working in the maritime sphere in order to give it all the impetus, dynamism and scope it needs to absorb some of the demand for transport and to be fully integrated into an intermodal transport system which is more rational and more respectful of the environment.
transport	transport_nou	On my first point, electronic, distance-related charges - called road pricing in short - for goods transport by road or even for private motorists may in theory be fairer than non-use-related charges.
transport	transport_nou	As long as we continue to subsidize environmentally-damaging agriculture which promotes pesticide use, invest in anti-environmental road transport and support nuclear power production, diseases caused by this anti-environmental policy will continue to increase.
transport	transport_nou	The European Union and Canada have agreed to cooperate on air transport with the aim of mitigating the impact of aviation on climate change.
transport	transport_nou	Any other way of managing the transport of animals, other than what has been proposed above, is unacceptable.
transport	transport_nou	A clear limit on weekly driving times, the impossibility of bypassing rest breaks, a simplified daily rest period, regular weekly rest periods, a standard policy in relation to interpreting and applying the regulation, the extraterritoriality of penalties and greater accountability throughout the transport chain: these are the main breakthroughs in the regulation.
transport	transport_nou	Inland waterways transport also emits less greenhouse gas.
transport	transport_nou	The priority objective of the second phase of the 2006-2007 action plan is the promotion of access to transport services and non-discrimination, in accordance with the communication recently adopted by the Commission on the situation of disabled people in the enlarged European Union.
transport	transport_nou	It was not much publicised but short sea shipping was the only mode of transport which, during the 90s, could more or less keep pace with the development of road transport.
transport	transport_nou	Efficient transport infrastructures are essential for economic growth and employment, as they are for the competitiveness of companies which depend on the movement of persons, goods and resources.
transport	transport_nou	I wish to add that, as a number of speakers said, air transport is developing at a rapid pace, and even though in certain cases high-speed rail transport may take up part of the market share, air transport is a means of travel that will continue to evolve in years to come: I think that this is certainly the case.
transport	transport_nou	In order to limit the transport of animals for slaughter, the European Parliament advocates the use of mobile slaughterhouses.
transport	transport_nou	In the budget vote I voted for CAP reform, for cuts in Tobacco subsidies, for the end of the transport of lives animals over 8 hours, against cuts in the Northern Ireland peace programme and for assistance to ACP banana and sugar producers.
transport	transport_nou	All serious waste-related crimes, including the illegal treatment, transport, export and import of waste, are covered by the proposed directive.
transport	transport_nou	I always find it somewhat amusing that people who are so interested in animals focus their energies on transport, but the minute an animal is slaughtered, their interest dwindles.
transport	transport_nou	Our environment would benefit from the obvious saving in terms of transport: the lorry that comes to the farm to collect the maize or forage peas being sold, and the one that comes to deliver the compound feed.
transport	transport_nou	We will take the pressure off quite substantially if we try to make the best use of all modes of transport and combine them in the best way we can.
transport	transport_nou	Estimates of the cost of developing satisfactory and modern transport networks in Europe vary, but I should like to mention, by way of indication, that an estimate of the transport infrastructure needs in Central Europe has given a figure of ECU 100 billion by 2015 for the modernisation of 20 000 km of rail and road networks, to bring them up to the current specifications.
transport	transport_nou	The aim of this Fund would be, on the one hand, to help normal public life to resume, for example by repairing energy, transport and telecommunications networks, rebuilding or building temporary accommodation, and, on the other, to limit damage by consolidating preventative infrastructures, for example dikes and dams.
transport	transport_nou	While the granting of aids for combined transport would be exempt from the strict authorization procedure under Article 93(3) of the Treaty, Member States would be required to inform the Commission of aids granted in the form of an annual estimate at the beginning of each year and subsequently report at the end of the financial year.
transport	transport_nou	This was issued by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and relates only to the transport of dangerous goods between Member States and not to transport within the confines of one country.
transport	transport_nou	Goods transport by rail is still subordinate to passenger transport by rail and its average speed is therefore not very competitive.
transport	transport_nou	This is also very important to enterprises in my country, in particular transport companies, that still fail to reach agreements with other countries concerning the timely refund of the VAT.
transport	transport_nou	In Romania's case, I can mention the deduction, when calculating taxable profit, of sums relating to the purchase of equipment and to equipment used in the production process by a disabled person, of the transport costs for disabled people from their home to the place of work, as well as the discount from the insurance budget for unemployment of the specific costs for preparation, professional training and advice.
transport	transport_nou	I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
transport	transport_nou	Although this protocol has yet to be accepted by all eight Alpine Convention states, we will do our utmost to ensure that it is ratified shortly by the other states of the region so that this ratification of the 'Transport Protocol' becomes one of the European Commission's main priorities.
transport	transport_nou	The Committee on Transport and Tourism, in its recommendation for the second reading, nevertheless called again for penalties for driving offences imposed by one Member State to be recognized in all other Member States.
transport	transport_nou	The Group of the European People's Party will support the compromises we reached in the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the reserved sector - although we see that as a maximum definition - and on the question of open access to the network.
transport	transport_nou	In certain sectors the picture is unfavourable, with the take-up rate of funding being extremely low or non-existent, while in other sectors it is encouraging: for example, the progress made with major infrastructural projects in the transport and energy sectors and with regard to the environment, research and technology.
transport	transport_nou	The transport sector is responsible for approximately 25% of polluting emissions.
transport	transport_nou	Of course, public transport must be run as cost effectively as possible but, in view of its decisive role and society's overriding responsibility to provide for people's needs, cost effectiveness cannot be the only driving force for the operation of public transport.
transport	transport_nou	Report (A5-0364/2001) by Erik Meijer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway (COM(2000) 7 - C5-0326/2000 - 2000/0212(COD))
transport	transport_nou	Secondly, the Commission is proposing to produce a white paper on trans-European transport networks.
transport	transport_nou	The third proposal, on aid for transport by road, rail and inland waterway, will provide the Member States with subsidies for investment in inland waterway terminals and fixed and mobile loading and unloading equipment up to 31 December 1999.
transport	transport_nou	Depopulation may be combated, in particular by maintaining public services in rural areas (schools, post offices, transport services), and social facilities may be maintained by pooling the resources of several communes, for example, or by resorting to the use of mobile services.
transport	transport_nou	We would have no decent healthcare for the vast majority of people, no education, no public transport, no environmental protection and no services for the aged.
transport	transport_nou	The transport sector consists of many small diffuse sources that we thought would be difficult to monitor, administer and control.
transport	transport_nou	Secondly, I should like to mention that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has approved an amendment to allow the inspection of most aircraft showing potential signs of a defect with safety implications. article 5 of the original text envisaged the inspection of just 10 % of such aircraft.
transport	transport_nou	That said, we still have a long way to go before road freight transport bears a reasonable proportion of the costs it represents for our societies: wear and tear of infrastructure, pollution, public health and accidents.
transport	transport_nou	We must ward off any attempt to fragment European policies and European structure as a whole in areas of cultural products and services, including new technologies, intellectual ownership, and all the other rights of our artists and creators. But we must not forget that other areas are also at issue, as has already been mentioned, such as transport, fishing and agriculture.
upset	None	And it will upset them retroactively.
upset	upset_vrb	I feel that the text adopted in committee is genuinely well balanced and that, should the amendments rejected in committee and put forward again for the vote in Parliament be adopted now, this balance could be seriously upset.
upset	upset_vrb	I appreciate the effort you are making and I do not want to upset the order.
upset	upset_vrb	In practical terms, enlargement will upset the balance and distort the statistics on which we have built this cohesion policy, for we have based it on what is certainly a statistic, the number of inhabitants and the average income disparity which will be created.
upset	upset_vrb	While some of the proposed adjustments are acceptable, others would upset this balance either by removing key information or by adding extra requirements which would impose costs without bringing any real benefits to consumers.
upset	upset_vrb	Obviously, all this is going to upset a few habits.
upset	upset_nou	The Cyprus authorities blame all the confusion on the European Commission, and the citizens are understandably rather upset.
upset	upset_nou	I do not know whether their disappearance is due to a stomach upset or a problem with the air conditioning.
upset	upset_vrb	Many of Amnesty International's reports concern Turkey and this has upset the army-controlled 'deep state' establishment in that country.
upset	upset_nou	I am very upset by the letter that Mr Verheugen sent to Mr Barroso 25 days ago, in which he interfered with Mr Dimas' responsibilities.
upset	upset_nou	Mr President, I too voted against this report and I am pleased that Parliament has voted against it - I would have been very upset if the opposite had happened - because, under the pretext of protective women immigrants, in fact, the report was trying to put through a principle favouring uncontrolled immigration, unregulated immigration.
upset	upset_vrb	Information should upset politics.
upset	upset_vrb	What does, however, occasionally upset the Moroccan authorities, and this I can understand, is that we sometimes tend to establish a little too easily a link between people from Morocco and security risks.
upset	upset_vrb	I have read in the press that we in the European Parliament could possibly upset the timetable because we are pressing for parliamentary codecision.
upset	upset_vrb	It could also upset the stability of state finances.
upset	upset_vrb	When it comes to the issue of whether or not Eurojust should be mentioned in this context, it has emerged that many people interpret the wording in terms of a desire to upset the balance of power between the executive and the judiciary.
upset	upset_vrb	He does not permit any votes that might upset his so-called consensus method, the same consensus method that he now wants to introduce, in place of unanimity, as the European Council's form of decision-making.
upset	upset_vrb	Under these circumstances, the debate that has been organised in this House is nothing other than a petty political and partisan scheme to upset a political opponent.
upset	upset_vrb	This is, yet again, a 'lukewarm' resolution and I am beginning to fear that my friends in the PPE have developed the Socialist group's syndrome, which is, as we all know, to never make waves and not to upset the governments.
upset	None	In the past my country has suffered from an influx of revolutionary elements from a foreign country, so to speak, but at no point was there any possibility that we could have upset the international order by ignoring frontiers.
upset	upset_nou	I too observed the elections and saw the voters participate in an extremely important democratic process, which has, however, been upset by disturbing events.
upset	upset_vrb	We are currently considering how to organize these consultation processes in such a way as to ensure that they enhance the decision-making process and do not upset the operation of the financial markets.
upset	upset_vrb	Therefore, and because it is important, Commissioner, I want to call on you, on behalf of all my fellow members, not to upset the balance and for the promised legislation to be put in place soon.
upset	upset_vrb	Yet this House, in approving the implementation of control by satellite, which the fishermen's organizations consider to be the only suitable form of control, had explicitly retained, as I proposed, the principle of financial compensation, so that this new arrangement does not upset the financial balance of our small fishing companies, which is often precarious.
upset	upset_vrb	Neither should our strategic autonomy upset our political and technical cooperation with the NATO powers.
upset	upset_vrb	I shall vote in favour of it – provided, of course, that this balance is not upset by the adoption in plenary of new amendments that are unduly harsh on Turkey.
upset	upset_nou	Due to their lack of transparency, these negotiations caused a great deal of upset and were thus the focus of public attention.
upset	upset_vrb	Whatever the result of the vote may be, and I hope it will be positive, it will not upset the relations between the European Parliament and the people and democratic government of Chile.
uses	uses_vrb	It seems even stranger that the Commission, refusing to apply to itself the principles that it applies to others, uses the Structural Funds as a channel for distributing Community aid which distorts competition and helps to encourage artificial relocation, as we have just seen with the case of the Japanese enterprise JVC in France.
uses	None	Let us remember that Iraq is one of the 'rogue' states, which the US Government uses to justify its antimissile defence programme.
uses	None	Now what is, in my view, an unprecedented event has occurred in that the Council is keeping the uses to which the money is put a secret.
uses	uses_nou	In pursuing this aim, account was also to be taken of the legitimate uses of the sea, technical feasibility and the radiological effects on man and organisms.
uses	uses_vrb	This was a change to the Rules introduced some years ago specifically to deal with this sort of situation. It caters for the fact that one political group, or indeed a group of Members, deliberately uses the Rules to try, in a sense, to filibuster or, possibly, to abuse the system of requesting roll call votes.
uses	uses_vrb	In the domain of the implementation of Community law, the Commission needs to demonstrate greater transparency when it uses its discretionary power to initiate infringement proceedings, in particular in the pre-litigation stage provided for by Article 169 of the Treaty.
uses	uses_vrb	We are trying to implement a political solution that uses force on the basis of respect for human rights, common security and the return of all refugees, on the basis of the international community.
uses	None	These credit cards have security marks. Every credit-card issuer uses a different one.
uses	None	You cannot define a substance as 'dangerous' on the basis of its properties, but only on the basis of its uses.
uses	None	Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
uses	uses_vrb	I do not wish to accuse Mr Lafontaine of being schizophrenic, but when he goes to Washington to speak for the Community, the language he uses will inevitably be different from that which he uses as Minister of Finance in Germany. This will not increase the credit, or in any case the credibility, of monetary union in the eyes of the world's major financiers and finance ministers.
uses	uses_nou	You are right to say that we must avoid any kind of storage that might subsequently lead to uses that are unacceptable in terms of our fundamental rights.
uses	uses_nou	As far as farmers are concerned, harmonising the systems of the three zones will make it easier to access the products, and a fund for minor uses, as envisaged and guaranteed by the Commission, will mean that we have products placed on the market that are designed for minor cultivation and gardening purposes.
uses	uses_nou	We have simply confirmed, in accordance with our rules, that Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure already gives the President of Parliament the right to bring an end to successive uses of points of order, procedural motions etc., 'where the President is convinced that these are manifestly intended to cause and will result in a prolonged and serious obstruction of the procedures of the House or the rights of other Members'.
uses	uses_nou	For those particular uses, two-stroke technology is the only viable option.
uses	uses_vrb	As pointed out in the report, the Commission uses a new internal procedure empowering each Commissioner to adopt and transmit communications to the Ombudsman.
uses	uses_vrb	A Parliament is measured by the way in which it uses and puts into practice its rights and by the fact that it does not withdraw from major political debate.
uses	uses_vrb	It is true that we are still debating what will happen to the Bank' s activities in the cases where it uses own resources.
uses	uses_vrb	Andorra uses the euro, the Channel Islands use the pound sterling, but they pick and choose which laws they want to follow.
uses	uses_vrb	No one has yet been able to ask the Palestinian Authority how much support it receives from the Arab League and how it uses it, nor what part of this contributes to dialogue, mutual understanding, as well as cultural and scientific development.
uses	uses_vrb	It also uses sport to promote public health, and I believe we should take that aspect into consideration by rectifying a long-standing omission and giving sport a legal basis in the Treaty, which is under negotiation again at the present time.
uses	uses_vrb	They are the following three areas: the role of non-executive directors; directors' responsibility for company accounts; full disclosure in the company accounts of offshore special purpose vehicles, including the reason why the company uses those offshore structures and a much stricter verification by the group auditor of their content.
uses	uses_vrb	The government of President Karimov uses this spectre, this more or less genuine threat from fundamentalists, as a way of keeping his oppressive regime in power.
uses	uses_vrb	However, the European Union will only be a credible global defender of human rights if in its own territory it uses unfailingly every instrument available to defend the values expressed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
uses	uses_vrb	Each country has the inalienable sovereign right to decide how it uses its raw materials or how it trades in its commodities.
uses	uses_vrb	The details of the matter have been examined, in particular the role of the well-known Belgian companies which the Commission uses and seems to have used quite extensively to deal with things like the MED programmes.
uses	uses_vrb	In other countries, the government uses taxpayers' money to finance newspapers used for its own benefit.
uses	uses_vrb	It is an amendment which uses a mechanism of the Treaty itself to sideline everyone, enabling not just an amendment without any democratic participation - and, furthermore, continuing what they did by rejecting national referenda to adopt the Treaty - it creates a mechanism enabling permanent monitoring of Member States' economies.
uses	uses_vrb	Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Commission not only serves growth and job creation through many programmes but also uses taxpayers' money responsibly and demands similar responsibility from the Member States.
uses	uses_vrb	As for the issues raised regarding labelling, I am of the opinion that they cannot be resolved merely by regulation, and that the crucial factor is the trust that exists between the manufacturer of the feeds and the livestock farmer who uses them.
uses	uses_vrb	.– We voted against the disgraceful resolution which uses Goebbels' methods to pervert and distort history.
uses	uses_vrb	(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest figures given in the annual report on the activities of Eurodac for 2006, which is the biometric tool that Europe uses for monitoring asylum seekers, show that the number of persons who illegally crossed one of the EU borders has increased by 64% since 2005.
uses	uses_vrb	This is due to a line in a Canadian diplomat's report some years ago, which is still included in the country information the UK uses.
uses	uses_vrb	Scarcely any other institution possesses so many structures and so many means for supporting communication, yet scarcely any other institution uses a language the complexity of which leaves it wide open to deliberate or involuntary misinterpretations.
wind	wind_vrb	The Agency has entirely fulfilled its mandate and it can now wind down its activities; this is planned for the end of 2008 in order to entrust the management of assistance to Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to the Commission delegations in those countries.
wind	wind_vrb	(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will wind up my speech but, before I do, I should like to say something about the outcome of the Irish referendum, especially in connection with enlargement.
wind	wind_vrb	As regards the Commission statement on the effect on the marine environment of low frequency active sonar, I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group for motions for resolutions to be tabled to wind up the debate.
wind	wind_vrb	I have received seven motions for resolutions to wind up this debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2).
wind	wind_vrb	To wind up the debate, four motions for resolutions have been tabled under Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
wind	wind_vrb	I shall give the floor to Commissioner Reding to wind up the debate on Mr Watson' s report.
wind	wind_vrb	But in talking about the European Union's major objectives I will wind up this list by mentioning two areas in which I feel there is a painful lack of ambition.
wind	wind_vrb	To wind up the debate, one motion for a resolution has been tabled pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
wind	wind_vrb	I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, and a vote will take place on these at 12.30 p.m. today.
wind	wind_vrb	It sets up a process to wind up the 'Oil for Food' programme while ensuring that oil can only be sold for the benefit of the Iraqi people and it creates a new fund for the reconstruction and humanitarian needs of Iraq which involves the IMF and the World Bank.
wind	None	The Channel is a particularly illuminating example in this respect: a strategic maritime gateway to the European Union, it is both an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (it contains 20% of the world's fleet and more than 500 vessels over 300 tonnes sail through it every day) and an area dedicated to fishing, leisure activities, aggregate extraction and soon - much to my satisfaction - energy production from offshore wind farms.
wind	wind_vrb	Naturally, I very much hope, as do the rapporteurs and my fellow Committee members, that the Council will write this letter and submit this declaration accordingly so that we can actually conclude the matter and do not wind up in a conciliation procedure after all, on the basis of the compromise which has now been achieved.
wind	wind_nou	The Arab world has been shaken for a month and a half, from Tunisia to Yemen, by a shockwave or wind of freedom.
wind	wind_nou	It is high time that a fresh wind blew through Windhoek and that the homosexual wall in a number of frontline states was razed to the ground.
wind	wind_nou	The Eastern Partnership and the Euronest Assembly are a good platform for such an engagement, and I feel that there is a new wind coming from Azerbaijan, a renewed wish for political dialogue.
wind	wind_nou	At the same time, as we have seen tonight, some of us fear that this wind of change will not necessarily lead to secularism or to the continuation of a secular state, to moderation or to stability.
wind	wind_nou	It will make an important contribution to innovation in electricity generated from wind, solar, hydro and biomass.
wind	wind_nou	I suppose that algae does not differentiate between Sweden, Latvia or other nations, as it is driven by the wind.
wind	wind_nou	That is proof that the wind of freedom is now blowing against the theocracies in the Middle East and in the Arab countries, too, and that it is our job to help them.
wind	wind_nou	There is indeed unease in certain countries and certain quarters that the wind of global competition can be a chill wind for some.
