81	advocate	advocate_vrb	It is recklessly perverse to advocate military action of this kind, and the effect of it is to give the green light to European troops being used to wage war in the Lebanon.		
82	advocate	advocate_vrb	I advocate that an end should be put to the dumping of Europe's overproduction on the markets of the South because this market-disrupting practice devastates local producers there.		
83	advocate	advocate_vrb	We do not wish to restrict ourselves to a single type of design for this, however, and for this reason, in Amendment No 12, we advocate a general heat-resistant material.

94	advocate	advocate_vrb	The time has come for us to rethink our strategy so that we follow the most effective path, in accordance with the values that we advocate and seek to promote.		
95	advocate	advocate_vrb	We are also trying to help others raise their social standards, but I certainly do not advocate that Europe should shut itself off.		
96	advocate	advocate_vrb	We are opposed to the creation of a European Corps with Member States’ competences. What we advocate is more effective national policy and proper cooperation between Member States.

102	advocate	advocate_vrb	"Our position has been to advocate an advisory rather than management procedure for the management of the regulation in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 which states: ""The management procedure should be followed as regards management measures such as those relating to the application of the common agricultural and common fisheries policies; also the implementation of programmes with substantial budgetary implications""."		
103	advocate	advocate_vrb	We advocate close inter state cooperation within the framework of the Third Pillar, where democratic control is executed, and indeed should be executed, by the National Parliaments.

109	advocate	advocate_vrb	We need a spirit of freedom and challenge in the search for the truth, in the fields of science, history and philosophy.

110	advocate	advocate_vrb	Finally, I would still advocate a strong country of origin principle.

80	close	close_vrb	I shall close on the issue of cross compliance.		
81	close	close_vrb	Let me close with something that is very close to my heart. Tibetans, both those in exile and those in Tibet, who have for 50 years used peaceful means to press for their rights, never resorting to terrorist actions of any kind, should not, in times like our own in which globalised terrorism predominates, be branded as terrorists, but are owed a tribute of respect for their peaceful approach.		
82	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament once again on this initiative.		
83	close	close_vrb	To close, I would remind you of the protests by Turkish Cypriots calling, Mr Van Orden, for Turkey to give them a say in their own affairs.		
84	close	close_vrb	Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, allow me to close by saying that I am certain that the European Parliament will support our proposals and will take advantage of this opportunity to put the commitment to solidarity which it has undertaken into further action.		
85	close	close_vrb	I would like to close on a note of optimism: good news seems to be coming from social Europe, to judge from the demonstrations in progress in the last few days.		
86	close	close_vrb	To close the catch-the-eye procedure, I say to you: catch the tax.		
87	close	close_vrb	I must close this very long debate. We are out of time.		
88	close	close_vrb	At the close of the financial year 2002, the available balance amounted to almost EUR 3 000 million. Outstanding commitments awaiting settlement amounted to more than EUR 8 000 million.		
89	close	close_vrb	"I should like to close by thanking the rapporteur for his sterling work and his willingness to cooperate during the procedure to examine and supplement his report in committee and I should like to pass on to you this succinct and, to my mind, rather dramatic appeal by a farmer in my region. As he said so very simply yet so very forcefully on hearing of the achievements of our Union: ""Europe yes, but a Europe for all the Europeans of the Union"" ."		
90	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to protest about the time at which this very important subject was tabled for debate.		
91	close	close_vrb	I close again with the words of our national poet: 'Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, Lest child, child's children, cry against you, 'Woe!''		
92	close	close_vrb	I would like to close, as I closed my earlier remarks, by referring to the outstanding record of the present Governor.		
93	close	close_vrb	I would like to close with a thought that will perhaps unite us all: I am able to remain quite composed throughout this entire debate for I really do believe that we are on the right road, because I know that the European car manufacturers and, more importantly, the European automotive suppliers - for they really are the driving force behind European industry - have not been asleep in recent years but have been working on a whole series of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to achieve our objectives.		
94	close	close_vrb	As this debate draws to a close, the request I should therefore like to make to the Commission is that in future we, that is the Council, the Commission and Parliament, discuss how democratic and economic reforms in those countries can be better and more effectively supported and how we can target the PHARE programme more selectively.		
95	close	close_vrb	To close, I believe that it is our duty, as an institution, to dedicate at least one more sitting of the European Parliament before the cut-off date of 2007 to debate this most serious issue.		
96	close	close_vrb	The important thing, it seems to me, is, above all else, the willingness to close the darkest chapters of our common history so as to be able to construct a new relationship, based on mutual respect, solidarity and partnership.		
97	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to assure you that the Commission will examine carefully every specific proposal which Parliament may present within the framework of debates on future regulations.		
98	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to thank the rapporteur, whose basic positions I agree with.		
99	close	close_vrb	The decision to grant discharge is a single act that cannot be divided up into a political decision on the discharge and a decision to close the accounts, which is to be taken at the same time.		
100	close	close_vrb	To close, I believe that an important job has been done and I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her efforts.		
101	close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to point out that, in the new financial perspectives, where we shall no longer have the Community initiatives as we have known them, we must not forget to also integrate this gender dimension, in keeping with the experience we already have and the new positions and proposals presented today in our rapporteur's proposal.		
102	close	close_vrb	I should like to close by saying that these young farmers do not just need reliable policies; they also need good wives and strong families.		
103	close	close_vrb	. Mr President, I just want to close very briefly, because much of what I said in general terms was a repetition of what we think.		
104	close	close_vrb	Human rights are one of the key factors in addressing the major challenges of our time: I do not need to mention the close connection between peace, security and stability, on the one hand, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, on the other.		
105	close	close_vrb	Finally, and to close, some Members have raised the question of border controls.		
106	close	close_vrb	Permit me, Mr President, to close by thanking all those that cooperated in this process, in other words the Commission, the Council, and particularly Mr Cashman and Mr Lax, who made especially active contributions to this report.		
107	close	close_vrb	We should help incoming President Obama to close this appalling chapter in America's and Europe's history.		
108	close	close_vrb	To close, Minister, it says in the paper you circulated to us, and I quote:		
109	close	close_vrb	I should like to close by repeating our aspiration.		
110	close	close_vrb	Before I close the debate, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has asked to raise a point of order.		
111	close	close_vrb	I would like to close by saying to you that this Statute, although not perfect, is a step forward, a step towards true European democracy.		
112	close	close_vrb	I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this.		
113	close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to recapitulate: firstly, labelling must be voluntary; secondly, labelling must be dominated by a spirit of transparency, so that no one doubts its reliability; thirdly, labelling must be by an independent authority and fourthly, this effort requires – and I emphasise this even though it is self-evident – fishermen to be present at the talks.		
114	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, on the effort which he made in successfully achieving a compromise between the divergent opinions formulated by his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and in the various political groups.		
115	close	close_vrb	Speaking of the Doha Round, I staunchly believe that we should try to close that round because it has a lot of important features, among them, that the existing tariffs cannot go up any more, that we would be able to close them down.		
116	close	close_vrb	Before I close, I would like to mention, and indeed to emphasise, the positive atmosphere that prevailed in our meetings with the European Parliament.		
117	close	close_vrb	We should really close this chapter once and for all.		
118	close	close_vrb	The time has come for Serbia to close this painful chapter and to make a new step towards reconciliation in the region.		
119	close	close_vrb	We do not therefore support the motion for a joint resolution due to be adopted at the close of this debate.		
120	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like once again to thank all the members of the European Parliament who have worked so intensively over the past nine months in order to make progress on the REACH proposal.		
121	close	close_vrb	I should like to close by emphasising the need to coordinate the activities of the European Investment Bank with all the policies of the European Union at national and European level.		
122	close	close_vrb	Officially, according to our agenda, we should close the debate at 11.50 a.m.		
123	close	close_vrb	I would like to close, therefore, by offering my sincere thanks, once again, to all those who were involved.		
124	close	close_vrb	To close, I have this to say: it is very important that we develop mechanisms in the European Union for receiving refugees, for accepting asylum seekers, not just for humanitarian reasons and for the reasons already referred to by numerous members, but also so that we can combat illegal immigration.		
125	close	close_vrb	I would like to close with an observation on the networks.		
126	close	close_vrb	I should like to close, Mr President, by saying that we have a duty to intervene at once in the Middle East in order to protect the Palestinians, in order to protect Israel from anti-Semitism and in order to protect the very future of democracy in Europe.		
127	close	close_vrb	By means of this agreement, reached amongst the majority of political groups in this House, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to close this regulation at second reading and provide political impetus for European construction.		
128	close	close_vrb	To close, I think that a great deal has been said about terrorism, but I wish to draw the Presidency's attention to the fact that the question of terrorism does not end with a few paragraphs.		
129	close	close_vrb	To close, I must say that, above all, the Luxembourg Presidency had the courage to go ahead with the referenda in these difficult times.		
130	close	close_vrb	To close, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Andrejevs, for the exceptional work he has done.		
131	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to protest about the time at which this very important subject was tabled for debate.		
132	close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to recapitulate: firstly, labelling must be voluntary; secondly, labelling must be dominated by a spirit of transparency, so that no one doubts its reliability; thirdly, labelling must be by an independent authority and fourthly, this effort requires – and I emphasise this even though it is self-evident – fishermen to be present at the talks.		
133	close	close_vrb	Two more points before I close: I think that attention should be focused more and more in future on neighbouring countries and less and less on the countries joining the European Union, precisely because the risk of squeezing out a nascent private market economy in these countries is greater. Lastly, I turn to the European Union as the majority EBRD shareholder.		
134	close	close_vrb	A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.		
135	close	close_vrb	I should like to close with one other point: the ex-ante procedures proposed by the Commission for examining state aid should worry us, not because subsidiarity is being suspended or superseded, but to see if they are compatible with the terms of state aid.		
136	close	close_vrb	Let me close by again praising the outstanding work that the rapporteur has done in drafting this wide-ranging and useful report, which will itself help to make society more aware of multiple sclerosis and of the problems associated with it.		
137	close	close_vrb	To close - and I am sorry that I do not have more time to reply to the very specific issues raised - I should just like to say before I forget, because a number of speakers referred to the economic recovery programmes, that they are indeed a very good idea, because there are numerous benefits from including projects to prevent disasters which we can more or less expect to happen next year as well - as previously said, we discuss these matters every year - both because they will generate economic activity and create more jobs and because they will prevent damage costing millions of euros in restoration works.		
138	close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to stress that I shall take account of Parliament's opinion and I shall evaluate the positions formulated both in Parliament and in the Council.		
139	close	close_vrb	I would like to close by saying to you that this Statute, although not perfect, is a step forward, a step towards true European democracy.		
140	close	close_vrb	The time has come for Serbia to close this painful chapter and to make a new step towards reconciliation in the region.		
141	close	close_vrb	I should like to close, Mr President, with a wish: that from now on the Council will operate with greater transparency, that it will talk to the rapporteurs early on, that it will attend European Parliament committees not simply to strengthen the role of the European Parliament but so that faster decisions can be taken, faster than the 16 kilometres an hour which is the present average speed of the railways.		
142	close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to point out that, in the new financial perspectives, where we shall no longer have the Community initiatives as we have known them, we must not forget to also integrate this gender dimension, in keeping with the experience we already have and the new positions and proposals presented today in our rapporteur's proposal.		
143	close	close_vrb	At the close of the financial year 2002, the available balance amounted to almost EUR 3 000 million. Outstanding commitments awaiting settlement amounted to more than EUR 8 000 million.		
144	close	close_vrb	I should like to close with a very small remark.		
145	close	close_vrb	Let us therefore give the rapporteur, Mr França, two minutes' speaking time to close this debate.		
146	close	close_vrb	To close, Mr Bush is coming, but he will have a macabre escort, the hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians murdered.		
147	close	close_vrb	We must not close the doors to the few migrants worldwide that take the road to Europe.		
148	close	close_vrb	This will help Serbia to close the tragic chapter of history over which Milosevic presided and to come to terms with the legacy of its past.		
149	close	close_vrb	If an entrepreneur today manages to sell a square soup dish by means of a very good marketing strategy, and then all manufacturers of round soup dishes have to close down, this will have no effect on culinary diversity.		
150	close	close_vrb	The only German political foundation that had been allowed to function in Minsk has had to close.		
151	close	close_vrb	The directive is aimed above all at mines that will begin to close in the future or at those abandoned mines that have been closed down without the proper and appropriate procedures.		
152	close	close_vrb	We do, as I say, welcome the efforts to close Guantánamo, but we oppose military commissions and other continuing abuses.		
153	close	close_vrb	The committee has emphasised that, following a proposal to run a private secondary school in Rizokarpaso, the Turkish conquerors are also threatening to close the primary school in the village, which is the only Greek school open in the occupied territory.		
154	close	close_vrb	Mr President, the brutal and unilateral decision taken by the management of Renault to close its subsidiary in Vilvorde profoundly shocked European public opinion.		
155	close	close_vrb	in writing. - It was about time to discuss a strategy for the Caucasus, and this strategy should not close its eyes to the unpleasant processes ongoing between Ukraine and Russia.		
156	close	close_vrb	The Commissioner said that Bulgaria has promised to close Kozludy.		
157	close	close_vrb	I do not think the results of the two referenda or the European Council should mean that we close the borders of Europe and stop competitiveness.		
158	close	close_vrb	Mr President, Commissioner Rehn stated recently in a article that the EU cannot close its doors to future enlargement, which is extended to all European countries with a European vocation and common democratic values.		
159	close	close_vrb	It is therefore of particular concern that Russia seeks to close the offices of the British Council in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.		
160	close	close_vrb	We do, as I say, welcome the efforts to close Guantánamo, but we oppose military commissions and other continuing abuses.		
161	close	close_vrb	We must close the gaps in our society in which terrorism can thrive, gaps that have arisen from misplaced tolerance.		
162	close	close_vrb	In the immediate future, the British and French governments must reach a practical agreement to process asylum claims on-site at the Sangatte centre, not close it - that would be counterproductive.		
163	close	close_vrb	It is no good calling on the Americans to close the place, which the new President is doing, if we cannot shoulder some responsibility.		
164	close	close_vrb	It is therefore likely that some Member States will be forced to close their coal mines and cope with the social and regional consequences of that decision.		
165	close	close_vrb	It is important not to close the door to Turkey, which can be said to be Europe's link to the Muslim world.		
166	close	close_vrb	The objective is not to close mines just for the sake of closing mines; it is to ensure energy security - and we are treating mines as if they were businesses.		
167	close	close_vrb	The European Union cannot close its eyes to the drama that is being acted out so close to it.		
168	close	close_vrb	Within the framework of EU accession talks, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria undertook to close and decommission these nuclear plants which, under the G7 negotiations, could not be modernised at a financially acceptable cost, and in which it was impossible to secure the minimum safety standards.		
169	close	close_vrb	The decision last week to close Chernobyl is belatedly welcome.		
170	close	close_vrb	We must be careful not to close our borders before we have conducted thorough analyses.		
171	close	close_vrb	As long as you close your eyes to the hunt for immigrants, the so-called 'sans-papiers', the deportation orders, the laws against poor people, as long as you forget that many people are refused the right to decent housing.		
172	close	close_vrb	I want to ask Commissioner Wallström if the Commission has any plans to require the applicant States to close down nuclear power stations before they can become members of the European Union. I would also add my name to the question asked earlier about what safety standard the EU has.		
173	close	close_vrb	Romania has started to develop a strategy to close large residential institutions for the disabled and replace them with alternative Community-based services in smaller residential units.		
174	close	close_vrb	I am one of those people who believe that the real answer to the desperation or futile hopes of human beings is obviously not to close our doors or to act brutally or inhumanely.		
175	close	close_vrb	We must close the gaps in our society in which terrorism can thrive, gaps that have arisen from misplaced tolerance.		
176	close	close_vrb	They wish to close the refugee camps and to force the occupants to seek asylum in third countries, particularly the United States.		
177	close	close_vrb	For people to tell us now to close our eyes, ears and mouths to reality is a cynical policy geared primarily to the interests of the European Union and not to the interests of democracy and human rights in Turkey.		
178	close	close_vrb	So I believe that we can no longer close our eyes to this problem but must face up to the need to offer all our citizens - not just the small percentage that can go to Oxford or Harvard to study foreign languages - the possibility of sharing a common language of communication.		
179	close	close_vrb	When you see the behaviour of the directors of many companies, especially the multinationals, who decide to restructure, relocate or even partially or totally close down their businesses, making hundreds or thousands of workers unemployed simply to cut costs and/or increase profits, it is all the more intolerable that the Council should not have accepted proposals that we have adopted in this House.		
180	close	close_vrb	We must not close doors; we must provide the possibility of review.		
181	close	close_vrb	Whilst I want the Czech Republic to join the EU, I cannot close my eyes to the fact that the Bene? decrees, which legitimised the expulsion of individual ethnic groups, continue to be in force there to this day.

81	live	live_vrb	I would also like to emphasise that promoting active citizenship must be undertaken for all of the Union’s citizens, by no means overlooking those who live in regions that are far from the centre of Europe, particularly the citizens of the outermost regions.		
82	live	live_vrb	People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.		
83	live	live_vrb	As more and more people in the European Union live, work, study and spend part of their lives in countries other than the one in which they were born or of which they are nominally citizens, this is going to become more and more necessary.		
84	live	live_vrb	We can also, on the other hand, make daily life easier for those who live on opposite sides of the external borders, but do so nonetheless as good neighbours.

100	live	live_vrb	In my opinion, European civil servants should have the same rights as those who live in any State of the Union.		
101	live	live_vrb	They are parties that live outside society: an expression of this - read last month' s Eurobarometer - is the ever-increasing distance between you, your bureaucracies and the citizens.		
102	live	live_vrb	This may be the case for patients who live in border regions, where healthcare provided abroad is sometimes closer than that provided in their own country.		
103	live	live_vrb	The text completely overlooks the situation of degradation in which the Roma communities live, in certain states such as Italy, not due to lack of integration policies but, quite the contrary, due to a deliberate decision to reject any rule of civil living.		
104	live	live_vrb	Probably that would be up to at least half the standard of the rest of continental Europe, but it is very welcome to those of us who live in that area.		
105	live	live_vrb	Whilst certain small countries live primarily off external demand, the large countries always rely primarily on internal demand.

113	live	live_vrb	Perhaps people could consider whether it would be possible to put eco-labels on certain areas where people work and live in a certain way, and also provide increased aid via the Structural Funds.		
114	live	live_vrb	The fact that 1.2 billion people living in the rural areas of developing countries live in poverty is a shocking indictment of the developed world, but equally the long-term development and sustainability of Third World economies depend on our efforts and - hopefully - success in helping them to develop and add value to their natural resources, with corresponding measures to assist with market access for their products.		
115	live	live_vrb	We have to ensure that all European citizens can live out their retirement with dignity.		
116	live	live_vrb	The people who live around the Mediterranean have needed no vote by a European Parliament to establish relations among each other, as they have done since time immemorial.		
117	live	live_vrb	Poor people live in the short term, in a day-today struggle to put food on the table.		
118	live	live_vrb	We know that most people in Europe live in towns and that current transport conditions are anything but optimal.		
119	live	live_vrb	Clearly the worst is the situation of those who live in remote localities, segregated settlements, often without access to school, electricity or running water, and in the regions with very high unemployment.		
120	live	live_vrb	I would like to point out that not all women in rural areas live in the same way.		
121	live	live_vrb	One billion two hundred thousand people live below the poverty threshold - which, I would point out, is a mere USD 1 a day - and I feel that this is the matter weighing on the civil and political consciences of all of us here, and it is right that it should.		
122	live	live_vrb	We must make rural development work for people and the places in which they live.		
123	live	live_vrb	We have to develop a territorial approach that suits the specific social conditions of the regions where most Roma live, and we have to do more to create employment for unskilled or low skilled people.		
124	live	live_vrb	Our culture programme reaches citizens where they live, which is our stated goal.		
125	live	live_vrb	I must add that there is a worrying racial aspect to this issue: the black immigrant labourers work separately, live separately and were removed separately by the police, having been fired upon and urged to leave the area around Rozzano, Calabria.		
126	live	live_vrb	There are also many species that have not yet been discovered and described. Most of these live in the soil or in rotting wood and are highly sensitive to change.		
127	live	live_vrb	The Roma live in many European countries - both Western and Eastern countries.		
128	live	live_vrb	These are people who live in insecurity every day, but who do not give up on their commitment to fight for an Iraq free of the military occupation, terrorism and armed resistance.		
129	live	live_vrb	These kinds of irresponsible statements are offensive to those who wish to live in a free, tolerant and open Poland.		
130	live	live_vrb	But it also states that we are entitled to take up employment in one country and live in another country, for example like transfrontier workers, who live in one country and have insurance in another.		
131	live	live_vrb	The contribution that the visitors who have come to live amongst us have made to life in many of our countries must be recognised and celebrated.		
132	live	live_vrb	It is an absolute ethical commitment which we must make our priority in order to allow our children to live in a future in which the values and the joys of living must not be jeopardized by the chemistry of drugs.		
133	live	live_vrb	But it also states that we are entitled to take up employment in one country and live in another country, for example like transfrontier workers, who live in one country and have insurance in another.		
134	live	live_vrb	Women have the right to live in safety, but a great number are not even safe in their own homes.		
135	live	live_vrb	It is an inalienable part of the European system of values that every individual should be allowed to live according to his or her religion and practise it.		
136	live	live_vrb	Therefore, the progress of incorporating non-citizens into local communities must go hand in hand with their resolution to accept that they live in Latvia or Estonia, that they are becoming citizens of the European Union, and not some other union.		
137	live	live_vrb	The people of Diego Garcia have been denied the right to live in their own homeland.		
138	live	live_vrb	There are problems on the labour market due to insecure contracts of employment and wages on which it is impossible to live.		
139	live	live_vrb	That 36 million people have to live with the HIV virus and that millions die of it every year must surely make an impression on those who only care about unborn lives and leave those who have been born to suffer and die.		
140	live	live_vrb	The people of Diego Garcia have been denied the right to live in their own homeland.		
141	live	live_vrb	We are very much in favour of the Palestinians being given a state in a dignified manner, and we are also very much in favour of Israel being able to live within secure borders.		
142	live	live_vrb	Our fellow citizens are prepared to live with this document as an interim report on their common history but have no desire to be taken hostage by it for decades, with all movement on what was the European compromise at the beginning of the twenty-first century indefinitely postponed.		
143	live	live_vrb	And how can anyone live on the margin, Mrs Pailler, without having the misfortune to lapse into practices that may become criminal?		
144	live	live_vrb	Saddam Hussein is certainly responsible and guilty, but we are also incurring a great deal of responsibility and guilt in continuing with a policy which maintains the population of a country in extreme poverty, a population such as the Iraqi people, with a rich history and culture, a population made up of people, women, children, who want to live.		
145	live	live_vrb	They have been demonstrating for their right to catch fish, to earn their living and to live in freedom and peace.		
146	live	live_vrb	We must reaffirm unequivocally the right of the Israeli people to live in peace and security within their internationally recognized and guaranteed borders.		
147	live	live_vrb	The proposal will ensure that this programme will make all European towns and cities better places to live and work and healthier places to bring up our children and go about our daily lives.		
148	live	live_vrb	It really is time that Europe's last divided capital at last became a living capital again and that Cypriots of both ethnic groups could live together in Cyprus in peace.		
149	live	live_vrb	Well, the transitional period of three years would have at least had the merit of showing us that we can very easily live, on the one hand, with a euro that is living its own rather chaotic life on the international markets and, on the other hand, with national currencies still in circulation, to the great satisfaction of consumers.		
150	live	live_vrb	More privatization also means that women will have to pay more premiums into private pension schemes if they live longer, and I wonder whether this will actually be the case.		
151	live	live_vrb	Let us live out in our daily lives the values of solidarity and brotherhood, adopting for ourselves the beautiful words of the writer Carlos Fuentes, which I quote: ' Our culture is not made from isolation but from communication, confrontation and contagion.		
152	live	live_vrb	We must acknowledge that science and technology allow us to live longer, to live under better conditions, to live with a more confident outlook and taking into account that food security conditions have improved, that the conditions of our welfare systems have improved, that conditions in our forward-looking world have improved, precisely because it has been able to use and exploit science and technology.		
153	live	live_vrb	The strangers who come knocking at our door more often than not come from countries which have completely failed to let their population live decently, or even to feed it.		
154	live	live_vrb	Yet, in the Western Sahara, there are dead and wounded people of a population that is only claiming the right to live in freedom in its own land.		
155	live	live_vrb	Yet, in Europe, many women and young girls continue to live in the shadow of aggression or exploitation.		
156	live	live_vrb	... and to have a State of Israel that can live in safety.		
157	live	live_vrb	Needing as we do the riches of the earth in order to live, we seek them out, process them and use them.		
158	live	live_vrb	We must accept that those who endure poverty have a right to live in dignity and participate in social and economic life.		
159	live	live_vrb	I agree 100% that Israelis have a right to live without the threat of rocket attacks.		
160	live	live_vrb	A society which seeks to develop prosperity and justice, and which wants more and more people to be able to live in acceptable environments must ensure economic growth.		
161	live	live_vrb	Yet the principle of the right to live as a family is simple.		
162	live	live_vrb	No nation can live and function like that.		
163	live	live_vrb	We must all live together on this globe.		
164	live	live_vrb	They do not want to live apart. They want to integrate, while retaining their identity.		
165	live	live_vrb	On that point, I consider its advocacy of the establishment of a minimum income threshold in all Member States to be of great value, so that everyone, whether or not they are employed, can live with dignity.		
166	live	live_vrb	We have been told many times by the new world that farmers have to live in that they have to face up to responsibilities and the marketplace and yet here we are preventing them from being able to compete in buying those medicines.		
167	live	live_vrb	I wish we were all there, together with those Palestinians and those Israelis who continue to believe that the best form of security for all peoples, for all people, lies in the mutual acknowledgement of the right to exist and live in one's own land in democracy and freedom.		
168	live	live_vrb	Everyone is entitled to decent housing and an income which allows them to live honourably.		
169	live	live_vrb	If we live in a European democracy, then of course, the core components of our constitutions must be mutually agreed and must be compatible with the international treaties that we have all signed.		
170	live	live_vrb	We do not live in a perfect world.		
171	live	live_vrb	We live in an internal market with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.		
172	live	live_vrb	I actually believe, and your intention was clear, that there is not really much point in Parliament and some of our fellow Members repeatedly criticising, month after month, global capitalism or total capitalism: we live in a world in which competition is becoming tougher and tougher and in which the future of the car industry is undoubtedly determined more by Renault-Nissan-GM alliances such as those announced, than by processes about which we are speaking today.		
173	live	live_vrb	I think that we live in a world now where food production is becoming very important again and we have to look to the future.		
174	live	live_vrb	The bottom line is that we live in a European Union where there is a system of free movement of services, capital, goods and persons.		
175	live	live_vrb	Those of us who live in the region are sick and tired of crises.		
176	live	live_vrb	Unfortunately, we live in an integrated European Union with a common market and most often all those decisions fail to have the sort of effect they once had.		
177	live	live_vrb	We do live, after all, in the twenty-first century.		
178	live	live_vrb	Mr President, we live in a world characterised by great material wealth, but the wealth is unevenly distributed.		
179	live	live_vrb	We live in a time in which traditional cooperation policies, implemented through mere humanitarian aid, no longer respond to the needs of developing countries, especially on the African continent.		
180	live	live_vrb	We live in a society dominated by information technology.		
181	live	live_vrb	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Commission on the complicated content of its initiative, but we must not let go of the importance of regulating the audiovisual policy in the age of high technology in which we live and which will become more and more important for our lives in the near future.		
182	live	live_vrb	. The free world in which we live would be no more than a mirage had we not forged the close and productive relations between Europe and the United States that have freed our continent from the yoke of Nazi and Communist totalitarianism.		
183	live	live_vrb	We live in a market economy, and commercial applications for which there is no demand are rarely developed.		
184	live	live_vrb	But we also live in a democracy, and these organizations must also obey the rules of democracy.		
185	live	live_vrb	. The free world in which we live would be no more than a mirage had we not forged the close and productive relations between Europe and the United States that have freed our continent from the yoke of Nazi and Communist totalitarianism.		
186	live	live_vrb	We live in interesting times.		
187	live	live_vrb	Yet we live in an era when Volkswagen, for example, has to appoint three apprentices to every training place in the developing countries because two out of three die during training, either from Aids or from other - water-borne - diseases.		
188	live	live_vrb	That must not be the kind of society in which we live.		
189	live	live_vrb	We do not live in a perfect world.		
190	live	live_vrb	We do not live in an ideal world and therefore, the compromise is not perfect either.		
191	live	live_vrb	Since we live in a media age, all of this was recorded and also broadcast live on television.		
192	live	live_vrb	We live in a world where half a million people move from a rural environment to an urban environment every single week.		
193	live	live_vrb	We live in a society which for reasons of solidarity and on economic grounds takes whatever steps need to be taken.		
194	live	live_vrb	We live in turbulent times.		
195	live	live_vrb	(DE) Mr President, it is no secret that we live in a European Union in which events are bypassing citizens and increasingly benefiting the major companies.		
196	live	live_vrb	Mr President, we live in difficult times where any lack of control can lead to irregularities or to fraud, and I am making a clear distinction between the two as Mr Santer previously requested.		
197	live	live_vrb	We now live in an internal market where there is free movement of persons across the territories of the EU, and we must take collective action together in an effort to deal with these issues effectively.		
198	live	live_vrb	I therefore appeal to you: let us live forever, as Mr Cohn-Bendit wants.		
199	live	live_vrb	We live in a world in which changes are on the way - in China, India and the United States.		
200	live	live_vrb	We no longer live in a post-war Europe where food security was a legitimate concern.		
201	live	live_vrb	Before appearing in Parliament today, I read of the concerns over cyber-spying, which is now regrettably a feature of the modern world in which we live.		
202	live	live_vrb	We live in the – perhaps illusory – hope that, in 2005, free elections will be held and a government enjoying popular legitimacy will be formed.		
203	live	live_vrb	For we live in an interconnected world, a world that requires solidarity at global level as much as it requires solidarity between European citizens.		
204	live	live_vrb	We live in a world in which countries and people are increasingly interdependent, which is more divided and in which there is greater danger of tensions, large-scale migration, damage to the natural environment and increased crime.		
205	live	live_vrb	The world is not waiting for us to take advantage of the internal market we live in.		
206	live	live_vrb	Naturally, thereafter, the debate should be redistributed through all forms of the media, but civil society should not be placed in opposition to Parliaments, because we live in representative democracies and we have to work out a complex system.		
207	live	live_vrb	The consumer society we live in is not making us happy.		
208	live	live_vrb	We live in a global market, whether we like it or not.

81	lives	lives_nou	Nevertheless, we should not interfere in the private lives of the innocent.		
82	lives	lives_nou	Mr President, the new information and communication technologies have a fundamental impact on the daily lives of our citizens and on the very economy of our societies.		
83	lives	lives_nou	Simultaneously, PKK terrorist attacks continue unabated in the south-east and put the lives of Turkish soldiers at risk.		
84	lives	lives_nou	They claimed numerous lives and inflicted massive physical damage.		
85	lives	lives_nou	Bodies lie in the streets – victims of all sides – and children caught stealing beg for mercy to spare their lives.		
86	lives	lives_nou	We pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives and to those who continue their work in such an environment.		
87	lives	lives_nou	My concern is two-fold: first, the extent of redundancy in the text – there may be circumstances in which repetition is used to good effect, but I do not consider that this is one of them; secondly, the range of issues covered – I believe that the European Parliament should be taking seriously all aspects of the lives of women in the fisheries sector and doing its best to address the problems that affect them.		
88	lives	lives_nou	New instruments and measures have been proposed that will enhance the lives of immigrants and their relationship with their countries of origin.		
89	lives	lives_nou	We have here legislation that will make a real impact on the lives of the 12 to 14 million third country nationals living in the European Union and the 4 million black Europeans.		
90	lives	lives_nou	This violent expression of scorn for employees and their lives fundamentally contradicts our stated objectives in favour of employment, social and regional cohesion, and the European Social Model.		
91	lives	lives_nou	I know that your expectations are high, and I count on your help in building solutions to support the invaluable contribution that health professionals make to the lives of each and every one of us.		
92	lives	lives_nou	The terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, which claimed the lives of two hundred innocent civilians showed us again that the human ability to destroy knows no limits.		
93	lives	lives_nou	Priorities must be in the best interests of our constituents and aimed at making their lives easier.		
94	lives	lives_nou	It is much more newsworthy to talk about crime than about the everyday lives of normal people.		
95	lives	lives_nou	The daily lives of Israelis are becoming more and more difficult.		
96	lives	lives_nou	Two hundred thousand people have lost their lives as a result of ethnic cleansing and pogroms, and a further two and a half million have been displaced.		
97	lives	lives_nou	They risk their lives to flee from dictatorships, conflict and misery.		
98	lives	lives_nou	It may help them in their everyday lives.		
99	lives	lives_nou	(DE) Mr President, our lives, and especially the lives of young people today, revolve around the internet to a significant degree, and both the digital revolution and the use of electronic means of communication are contributing to progress in this field.		
100	lives	lives_nou	One of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation.		
101	lives	lives_nou	The lives of more of our citizens are blighted by the lack of access to civil justice or cross-border redress mechanisms than, fortunately, are directly touched by terrorism.		
102	lives	lives_nou	Coal will nevertheless play a key role in our lives in the foreseeable future.		
103	lives	lives_nou	All are struggling to rebuild their lives.		
104	lives	lives_nou	We must give women the possibility to harmonise their careers and family lives, and the possibility to choose.		
105	lives	lives_nou	There is also the issue of the private sphere and of the increasing monitoring of every area of our lives.		
106	lives	lives_nou	These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.		
107	lives	lives_nou	They want to have control over their lives, and we must help them.		
108	lives	lives_nou	In the face of the Palestinian, Arab or Middle Eastern citizens, who die every day, assassinated by their Saudi or fundamentalist right- or left-wing regimes, assassinated by the firm, historic alliance of Sheikhs and Middle Eastern rulers, who are allied with the great oil multinationals and with you, the more or less communist left; in the face of the situation of the Kurds, which is not just a Turkish problem but also an Iraqi problem and the problem of others as well; in the face of the everyday lives of the Saudi and Palestinian men and women, you are only concerned with them if Israel is involved, and it may have done them some serious damage.		
109	lives	lives_nou	People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.		
110	lives	lives_nou	The minorities also include refugees from Tibet, who have been obliged to leave their homeland in fear of their lives, and who pass through Nepal on their way to India.		
111	lives	lives_nou	They take terrible risks with their lives and the lives of their children in order to escape persecution or penury.		
112	lives	lives_nou	We will always need your support for a sustained peace process, and a support for the peace camps that lit the candles for all those who lost their lives in the ignorant battle.		
113	lives	lives_nou	More people must work for a longer portion of their lives, given the way we are living at present.		
114	lives	lives_nou	When we legislate, we create changes that will have a direct impact on the lives of 500 million people in the years to come, while for own-initiative reports this transfer takes much longer and is much smaller.		
115	lives	lives_nou	We have one common mission: we need to do all we can to protect the lives of innocent citizens, including women and children, when no one else can.		
116	lives	lives_nou	So that one can wonder whether the very idea of a single currency, the merits of which have been so vaunted to us to make tourists' lives easier, is not already at least outmoded from this point of view.		
117	lives	lives_nou	People have a right to keep details of their lives confidential, but authorities have not only a right, but a duty, to safeguard the lives of their peoples.		
118	lives	lives_nou	As far as possible, our electors should be allowed to get on with their lives, but we as politicians cannot rest while terrorism lives.		
119	lives	lives_nou	Secondly, we have a bolder use of 'non-standard' forms of employment, which particularly enable young people preparing to launch themselves into their working lives both to obtain practical skills and to cover the costs of their vocational education.		
120	lives	lives_nou	That affects their lives and the lives of their families and it has a very significant medical, social and economic cost.		
121	lives	lives_nou	Speaking out in order to save lives and to ensure that the free will of the people of East Timor is respected.		
122	lives	lives_nou	It is destroying lives and livelihoods.		
123	lives	lives_nou	All of us must now do our utmost to make sure that orphan or abandoned children do not have to grow up in children's homes and other institutions, but in families where they will receive the affection that can carry them right through to their adult lives, so that they will become healthy, rather than damaged adults.		
124	lives	lives_nou	If terrorists were to start biological attacks across Europe, many lives would be at risk and our lifestyle could change dramatically.		
125	lives	lives_nou	The introduction of the electronic stability programme for passenger cars and for commercial vehicles, in particular, can save almost 3 000 lives a year and prevent serious injuries for 25 000 people.		
126	lives	lives_nou	Despite the gravity of the losses, a thousand lives were saved by more than a thousand international search and rescue teams, and this Parliament should join with the head of the UN team in Bam who has described it as the best disaster response he has seen in 20 years.		
127	lives	lives_nou	Madam President, Commissioner, it is not possible to put a price on the human lives lost in disasters.		
128	lives	lives_nou	However, it is a question here of protecting lives.		
129	lives	lives_nou	Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.		
130	lives	lives_nou	Naturally we deeply regret the loss of many lives and the displacement of nearly 40,000 people from their homes as a result of military activity in the Caucasus region.		
131	lives	lives_nou	The 2000 human lives that were lost through the tragedies of the Herald of Free Enterprise , the Scandinavian Star and the Estonia should be sufficient to mobilise all the European institutions and transport companies to do everything in their power to improve safety on these boats, which are unavoidable for many travellers.		
132	lives	lives_nou	This assessment and standard-setting framework must be sufficiently flexible so that it can be adapted to changing technologies, which, as well as making our lives easier, can also become a deadly weapon when in the hands of terrorists.		
133	lives	lives_nou	In that instance, saving the fish seems to have been more important than saving the lives of those desperate people: they were not taken on board the fishing vessel that came across them.		
134	lives	lives_nou	Dozens of human lives were lost, hundreds of individuals were injured, thousands of animals were killed, whole villages were burned to the ground and thousands of acres of forests were annihilated.		
135	lives	lives_nou	Barefoot children lack shoes to climb over the rubble of their former homes, and lives have been destroyed.		
136	lives	lives_nou	Russian menace lives, and has already penetrated our everyday consciousness, not only through energy prices but also in the image of columns of tanks filing into Georgia.		
137	lives	lives_nou	The bacterium costs lives, too many lives.		
138	lives	lives_nou	I agree that we need to be more aware of how we use resources in our daily lives and to research new technologies.		
139	lives	lives_nou	These evil men who toy with and destroy the lives of adults and children alike, who pay no respect to human rights, must be brought to book and the full rigour of the law brought to bear on them. Their ill-gotten gains must be frozen.		
140	lives	lives_nou	Perhaps it would be possible to save more lives if the rescuers could reach the affected area, but they are prevented by objective difficulties, as well as due to a shortage of adequate equipment.		
141	lives	lives_nou	Mr President, I would join my voice to those who have talked about the tragedy of Dover and the young lives cut short there, but I also want to add my revulsion at the attitude of many people: well, what do you expect, if you take these risks you have got to expect that you might die.		
142	lives	lives_nou	Effective investments in disaster prevention will help to save lives, limit damages and, ultimately, save money.		
143	lives	lives_nou	We also need to assess which strategies are capable of saving human lives; in our view, for instance, examples of this are the controlled administration of drugs and, more generally, the decriminalization of drug use.		
144	lives	lives_nou	One of the great successes of our Union has been this right to move freely, now enjoyed by millions of citizens in their studies, in their working lives, in retirement.		
145	lives	lives_nou	Standardization of safety measures both in the siting and the equipment of camp-sites could save lives, and I was encouraged by your positive response yesterday.		
146	lives	lives_nou	An authenticated telephone call to CNN and the other broadcast networks could have saved thousands of lives in Sri Lanka, Somalia and Thailand.		
147	lives	lives_nou	Our inaction will cost lives.		
148	lives	lives_nou	Secondly, they wish to rebuild through their own efforts the lives and natural resources that have been destroyed.		
149	lives	lives_nou	However, because it is topical and because human lives are at stake, I feel obliged to call your attention to it.		
150	lives	lives_nou	How many lives could have been saved!		
151	lives	lives_nou	Many lives are depending on these actions.		
152	lives	lives_nou	This matter is relevant to us obviously because of the horrific tragedy involving the loss of these young lives, but also because we have dealt with the use of seatbelts in public transport many times in this House with, I have to say, only limited success.		
153	lives	lives_nou	It is fitting that we express today our solidarity with the victims of that accident and that we recognise the serious impact that it had on so many lives.		
154	lives	lives_nou	It will make it possible for lives to be saved and for seriously injured people to obtain medical care more quickly, and this in accordance with the principle of the ‘golden hour’ whereby anyone who receives medical care within an hour has a much greater chance of surviving as well as of his or her injuries being less severe.		
155	lives	lives_nou	We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected.		
156	lives	lives_nou	Safety at sea is an aim in itself, I would say it justifies itself, and it is the duty of us all to ensure the safety of shipping to save both lives and property.		
157	lives	lives_nou	The road to rebuilding these lives is long and needs support.		
158	lives	lives_nou	Secure supplies of blood products save lives and must therefore be given absolute priority.		
159	lives	lives_nou	The tragedy of the lost lives has touched us in Parliament too in personal and direct ways.		
160	lives	lives_nou	The best way of reducing population growth is to save the lives of youngsters, so that people do not feel the need to have bigger families.

89	present	present_vrb	Modern information and communication technologies in themselves present an unprecedented opportunity to really promote cohesion and equal opportunities, but we can only use this opportunity if we guarantee the conditions to include everyone throughout their lives, so that, even for 'eskills', the title of the Committee's opinion will inevitably be true: 'It is never too late'.

91	present	present_vrb	The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages, such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets.		
92	present	present_vrb	Mr President, I am taking the floor on behalf of Mr Pittella, from Italy, and Mrs Madeira, from Portugal, to ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, in the proposals on the financial perspective that it is to present, to reincorporate the criteria proposed by the Commission on the regions affected by the statistical effect, with regard to the need to support them without any shameful discrimination amongst them, since, as I said in this very House on 9 March, this is a question of dignity, of making European policy comprehensible, of making it egalitarian, balanced and democratic, faithful to its roots and to its ambitions.		
93	present	present_vrb	As for the FIFG, we support the strategy of the report aimed at unifying regulations on activities in this sector, but we do not feel it necessary or even appropriate to present such a complete document at this stage as, for that very reason, we have not been able to sufficiently discuss all its implications.		
94	present	present_vrb	The parties were given the opportunity to present written and oral comments.		
95	present	present_vrb	We will continue our efforts to present a new long-term programme for 1998 and the year 2000.		
96	present	present_vrb	The Commission has decided to present a proposal which not only respects this own resources ceiling but also allows sufficient scope below this ceiling based on the average over the period.		
97	present	present_vrb	I therefore believe that the British Presidency has a great opportunity to present proposals aimed at making these objectives a reality.		
98	present	present_vrb	Mr President, obviously the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are those who suffer most in the conflicts between armed gangs which are tearing the country apart, but it is both pathetic and misleading to present these conflicts as if the only people to bear any responsibility were the opposing Congolese factions and their protectors in neighbouring African states and as if Europe' s calling for national reconciliation and democratisation could resolve the situation.		
99	present	present_vrb	It is a hypocritical attempt to present budget appropriations as available for unemployment and for employment, at a time when not a single ECU has been added to the European Union budget and when the titles of certain lines are simply being changed.		
100	present	present_vrb	I believe that the Commission could present either a proposal, for example, in the framework of consumer protection - consumer in this instance meaning citizen - or an initiative, which could also come from Parliament.		
101	present	present_vrb	It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.		
102	present	present_vrb	We should be the first to present different initiatives at conferences or whatever, to exchange good practice, and so on.		
103	present	present_vrb	The Commission announced its intention to present a Green Paper on forest protection and information in the context of the 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change.		
104	present	present_vrb	And this is proposed without even allowing the accused to put his case, denying any opportunity to present a defence, and this in regard to the chairman of a group here in this Parliament and an Austrian politician.		
105	present	present_vrb	I have voted against the resolution, because I cannot see why we should now throw away the Statute we have adopted and present the Council not with a law on the legal position of MEPs, but with mere pay scales, of which we cannot be other than ashamed and for which the public will laugh us to scorn.		
106	present	present_vrb	Today, we learn from the press that the Italian Government has decided not to present the resolution to the UN.		
107	present	present_vrb	This revision will enable us to present a single coherent wording, free of any contradictory definitions, to increase the transparency and clarity of the legislation on equality of treatment and to facilitate effective implementation by reinforcing the , avoiding any regression and incorporating all recent developments of European jurisprudence.		
108	present	present_vrb	Another question is whether it can be stated with absolute certainty that such a series of stress tests will not ignore any bank whose operation might present a risk to the European economy.		
109	present	present_vrb	We have tried to present a more acceptable formulation, which, sadly, I think is unlikely to succeed here at today's vote, and I would therefore urge colleagues to support the deletion, to allow us to return to this at conciliation and do the work properly.		
110	present	present_vrb	rapporteur. - Mr President, I am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity to present my report on early years learning in the European Union, which is an extremely important aspect of education that we have not really given much attention to before now.		
111	present	present_vrb	Commissioner, the Commission will have to present the European Council in Feira with a report on the development of a statute for the outermost regions, in accordance with Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.		
112	present	present_vrb	The draft budget that I am going to present to you incorporates a number of items that were discussed at length during the traditional conciliation meeting last July.		
113	present	present_vrb	The Commission announced its intention to present a Green Paper on forest protection and information in the context of the 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change.		
114	present	present_vrb	The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.		
115	present	present_vrb	"Madam President, we would like to present an oral amendment to Amendment No 5. Instead of ""triggered by unrest and acts of violence starting in the early sixties"" , we wish to replace the words ""triggered by"" with the words ""which followed"" ."		
116	present	present_vrb	As far as the contradiction between repressive policies and proactive policies is concerned, I feel that the Commission has strived to present a range of proposals that is balanced in both areas.		
117	present	present_vrb	As rapporteur, I must present the report on behalf of the committee, although personally I am not in favour of some of the committee amendments, notably the refusal to place a time limit on liability for damage occasioned by land filling.		
118	present	present_vrb	Mr Dimitrakopoulos, if you would like to present your oral amendment, Parliament will decide.		
119	present	present_vrb	Above all, I am very pleased to see that Parliament has had the courage to present our reports in the 'Lisbon' package to honour the promise made to the citizens to inform them of the consequences of this treaty.		
120	present	present_vrb	I would like to present the Commission's positions with regard to it.		
121	present	present_vrb	The difficulty that this report may present is the nature of the European authentic act or public document itself, which is recognised in most of the countries in the European Union but not in others.		
122	present	present_vrb	I will therefore try to present his report to you.		
123	present	present_vrb	The report aims to present the 1999 budget as a bridging budget between the financial perspective which is ending and that which we are discussing.		
124	present	present_vrb	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to present briefly the basic aspects of the critical issues dealt with by the four reports.		
125	present	present_vrb	I will therefore end by calling on the Commission to present these proposals very soon, that is to say, immediately after it receives those studies, so that, next year, Parliament can study them and recommend to the Member States what decisions should be taken, without any excessive delay.		
126	present	present_vrb	I believe that it was Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who said that if a State wants to apologise, present or express remorse or regret, at the end of the day, it is up to that State to know how far it can go.		
127	present	present_vrb	The rapporteur is going to present a technical modification of paragraph 120 rather than an oral amendment.		
128	present	present_vrb	Mr President, I am now putting on a different hat to present my report to Parliament.		
129	present	present_vrb	I ask you, fellow-Members, to start work and to present us with its results as soon as you possibly can.		
130	present	present_vrb	It notes the messages contained in other amendments, and will present the result of its deliberations as and when appropriate.		
131	present	present_vrb	The annual economic report that the Commission will present in just over a month' s time, indeed as part of the preparations for the Spring Council, will contain a detailed analysis of the situation, and substantial progress will, at last, have to be made in Barcelona.		
132	present	present_vrb	The Commission will soon present a framework decision on procedural safeguards and we are convinced that the initiative we will be taking in June this year to present a framework decision on minimum rules for data protection, under the third pillar, will be equally significant.		
133	present	present_vrb	In addition, the Commission will soon be adopting its second report on the incorporation of the money laundering Directive into national law, and expects to present it to Parliament before the summer recess.		
134	present	present_vrb	On this, the Commission will present its report in the autumn, and, like all its predecessors, this report will be fair and objective.		
135	present	present_vrb	It will present the study by 30 September 2013 at the latest and incorporate the positive results from the study into additional legislation.		
136	present	present_vrb	As you know, in the spring, the Commission will present a strategy for completing the transition to a low carbon economy by 2050.		
137	present	present_vrb	In order to take account of this fact and the many and varied viewpoints and concerns manifested on this subject, the Commission will present a proposal to the committee concerned to remove the sub-species from Annex 1 to Council Directive 79/409 on the Conservation of Wild Birds.		
138	present	present_vrb	The communication which the Commission will present at the informal summit in Lahti sets out such an approach.		
139	present	present_vrb	The Commission is analysing the situation and will soon present proposals on the basis of Cotonou Agreement, as was called for by Mr Kohlíček, Mr Gahler and Mr Tannock.		
140	present	present_vrb	Will the Commission present a new proposal in the health area?		
141	present	present_vrb	I think, therefore, that we should wait for the outcome of the two ongoing studies and discuss this issue on the basis of a report that the Commission will present to Parliament and the Council in 2005.		
142	present	present_vrb	We shall discuss this matter again together, Parliament, the Council and both of us with the Commission, which will soon present its summary report to us.		
143	present	present_vrb	The Commission will also present the legal framework for capturing and storing CO2, with the necessary guarantees on environmental protection.		
144	present	present_vrb	Other issues left pending from the Barcelona European Council and which will be addressed by the Seville Council are: the simplification and improvement of regulations - known as 'better regulation'; economic services of general interest - the Commission will also present the report that has been requested of it; energy supply - on which it will present another report; telecommunications, education, research; the outermost regions and sustainable development.

80	produce	produce_nou	In Northern Ireland, we rely heavily on the ability to export produce to the rest of the UK and other European countries.		
81	produce	produce_nou	A modest export trade is based on the sale of agricultural produce to neighbouring regions.		
82	produce	produce_nou	However, we think it essential for such aid to remain in proportion to the withdrawal compensation for fresh produce, if only to encourage processing rather than withdrawal or destruction.		
83	produce	produce_nou	So let us begin a joint action to combat child pornography as soon as possible and extend the competence of Europol, so that we can combat international networks which produce, sell and distribute pornographic material of this kind.		
84	produce	produce_nou	It is within the capacities of European agriculture to use agricultural land no longer required for food production to produce energy in the form of biomass.		
85	produce	produce_nou	The European agricultural policy came about in order to support our farmers and enhance the quality of European produce, so as to strengthen the EU's position in the world marketplace.		
86	produce	produce_nou	It is vital for farmers, whose prime function is to produce farm products, not to have to bear a higher rate than 5 % against a world context of greater demand and smaller stocks.		
87	produce	produce_nou	Moreover, there is a way of achieving this: by radically changing the way that we produce and use energy in our society.		
88	produce	produce_nou	Agricultural produce is a large element of ACP exports.		
89	produce	produce_nou	We believe that the market in general must be opened up for agricultural produce, which also includes soft fruits and cherries intended for processing.		
90	produce	produce_nou	The choice of which of the two sites to produce in was an indication of the difficulties that we were going to have to face on behalf of the Irish workers.		
91	produce	produce_nou	The budget imposes heavy fines on farmers who produce more than their quota of milk, yet the Commission refuses to intervene when large European commercial undertakings sell, and receive EU subsidies for, surplus butter adulterated with lubricants and beef tallow.		
92	produce	produce_nou	in writing. - I voted against this report as I question the propriety of granting Iceland any concessions regarding the importation of fisheries produce into the EU when they continue to persist with their approach on the management of mackerel, with the negative impact this is likely to have on EU pelagic fishermen.		
93	produce	produce_nou	In this area, we should extend the competence of Europol as soon as possible, so that we can combat international networks which produce, sell and distribute pornography of this kind.		
94	produce	produce_nou	The aim of the CAP is to produce a wide-range of crops throughout the Union.		
95	produce	produce_nou	It has been very important for us to try to help them, perhaps not to continue to produce sugar if they could not be competitive, but then to try to do something else.		
96	produce	produce_nou	The nature of the produce means that it must be processed and preserved, or destroyed.		
97	produce	produce_nou	We import a huge amount of cotton and what we do produce in no way supports exportation.		
98	produce	produce_nou	The 18 main produce types introduced by the new Member States are an issue that has still not been regulated.		
99	produce	produce_nou	Our produce must conform to the needs of the market and, in particular, to the requirements of importing countries, which means that we have to produce high-quality cereals.		
100	produce	produce_nou	Secondly, as he probably already knows, in previous incidents which have resulted in physical attacks on Spanish drivers hauling fruit and similar produce, there is a case before the Court of Justice and before too long there should be conclusions reached with particular relevance to that case.		
101	produce	produce_nou	They point out that both organic and conventional produce have been extensively tested and no nitrofen has been found.		
102	produce	produce_nou	Farmers often do not receive timely payment for their produce.		
103	produce	produce_nou	My fear is that some organic produce being imported into the EU is anything but organic.		
104	produce	produce_nou	The vested interests that produce these should be legally liable for insuring people's health if something goes wrong.		
105	produce	produce_nou	in writing. - I voted against this report as I question the propriety of granting Iceland any concessions regarding the importation of fisheries produce into the EU when they continue to persist with their approach on the management of mackerel, with the negative impact this is likely to have on EU pelagic fishermen.		
106	produce	produce_nou	For example, farmers ought to be paid for their produce within 30 days.		
107	produce	produce_nou	Local produce, such as berries and mushrooms, can contribute to a region's trademark image, strengthen its identity, its gastronomic reputation and encourage green tourism, which is essential to the rural economy.		
108	produce	produce_nou	Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate.		
109	produce	produce_nou	In order to encourage car manufacturers to continually increase the number of environmentally friendly cars they produce, consideration needs to be given, in the case of public procurement, to the costs incurred throughout the entire lifetime of the respective vehicles and their impact on the environment and public health.		
110	produce	produce_nou	It is clear for everyone to see that there is a worldwide growing demand for organic produce, and the EU Member States are no exception.		
111	produce	produce_nou	The conclusions from the report debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight to us that importing agricultural produce from third countries has a much greater detrimental impact on the environment than internal production, which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, making it conducive to climate change.		
112	produce	produce_nou	In addition to this, the appearance on their market of produce subsidised by the CAP will represent a real threat to their agriculture.		
113	produce	produce_nou	It is therefore only right that we respect first the land, which yields the produce, then the processor, if any, but above all the consumer.		
114	produce	produce_nou	But we need more if we want to give our Mediterranean policy a new lease of life: we need to involve the people more by supporting decentralised cooperation, we need to improve the way in which the cultural and human dimensions are integrated, open the free trade zone to agricultural produce and monitor and support fundamental freedoms.		
115	produce	produce_nou	It is within the capacities of European agriculture to use agricultural land no longer required for food production to produce energy in the form of biomass.		
116	produce	produce_nou	People are paying higher prices for organic produce.		
117	produce	produce_nou	The third reason has to do with who produces and owns the agricultural produce in numerous developing countries, where farming and agricultural produce are owned by huge multinationals paying starvation wages.		
118	produce	produce_nou	Given the difficulties the people there have in exporting their agricultural produce and the difficulties the Members experienced in travelling there, I cannot see how, in the event of a disaster, for example, these people could possibly cope without adequate resources.		
119	produce	produce_nou	We have to change our agricultural policy so that we no longer dump produce on the developing countries' markets.		
120	produce	produce_nou	The second has to do with the international system of prices and subsidies for agricultural produce and the international system of prices for industrial goods.		
121	produce	produce_nou	A new definition of healthy eating has been initiated; one of the stipulations is that healthy eating is possible only with organic produce.		
122	produce	produce_nou	These subsidies seriously damage the prospects of other countries, particularly developing ones, of maintaining a viable position on the market in agricultural produce.		
123	produce	produce_nou	Let me quote: ‘The rate of aid paid for artificially dried fodder is almost double that paid for sun-dried fodder. This encouraged producers to switch from sun-drying and to produce artificially dried fodder to the maximum extent possible.		
124	produce	produce_nou	It seems to me a good thing for farmers on a voluntary basis to add value to their produce through quality assurance schemes, and we should be supporting them, not discouraging them.		
125	produce	produce_nou	There has also been much talk of the effect of diverting agricultural produce to the production of biofuels as one of the main reasons for the increase in food prices.		
126	produce	produce_nou	On the other hand, another approach could be to exploit the produce of the land, such as fruit and the produce of the underwood, and to operate a system of controlled tree felling, which would produce an annual income of FF 2 000. In this case, the income would be regular, practically perennial.		
127	produce	produce_nou	With its endless reforms of the CAP, the European Union is becoming more and more product-deficient, ruining farmers and, at the same time, forcing developing countries, with extortionate agreements and price mechanisms, to sell their agricultural produce at knock-down prices, tightening the noose around the neck of their people and protecting the multinationals' profits.		
128	produce	produce_nou	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to European regulations that have laid down firm rules on the quality of agricultural produce, the health of citizens, environmental sustainability, and the specific characteristics of crops, we can say today with pride that European agriculture is a model without equal in the world.
