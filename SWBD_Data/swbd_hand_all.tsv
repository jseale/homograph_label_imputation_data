dove	dove_vrb	and we dove there
duplicate	duplicate_adj-nou	and i do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this
job	job	uh the previous job i used to have uh they
job	job	and so uh i got myself involved in a sales job
job	job	uh once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
job	job	they used to have job security crap
job	job	that was my brother s first job in a grocery store
job	job	and i guess another one that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a benefit
job	job	so we d have to have some way to uh reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
job	job	but uh it s the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours
job	job	i <unk> just gotten a another job at an elementary library at barron
job	job	uh you know they <unk> not going to do their job which is
job	job	you really have to think about that for the job
job	job	you need that first job or so out of school too
job	job	well like you say i mean if it s not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
job	job	and they you know had done such a good job
job	job	well it it s his job too
job	job	well i do n't job enough i think to develop any injuries
job	job	and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store
job	job	that s a wonderful wonderful job by robin williams and peter de <unk>
job	job	so she had to go i guess get a real job
job	job	one in real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job
job	job	he did a real good job i believe
job	job	and and maybe after we decide to have kids i i might find a job that has flexible hours
job	job	they <unk> in it because it s a profession not because it s a job they could get because they did n't qualify for anything else you know
job	job	they do an absolutely necessary job
job	job	and so but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
job	job	uh there s no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them
job	job	it was n't too much of a job really
job	job	um i guess we <unk> going to talk describe uh job benefits
job	job	so you you reached me at my job
job	job	i think that s an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident
job	job	and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able <unk>
job	job	well i b m does n't fire anybody because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job which <unk> you actually are like sitting around not doing anything
job	job	i travel a great deal with my job
job	job	and uh i really do n't have any job benefits to speak of
job	job	but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well
job	job	i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband s or what i think
job	job	i i think that plano has really done a fantastic job
job	job	is is is it doing a good job or a bad job
job	job	is is is it doing a good job or a bad job
job	job	the job was considerably tougher than we thought
job	job	and but it does it does its job
job	job	i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job
job	job	i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
job	job	he said um he should have let bush should have let him finish his job
job	job	what type of job do you have
job	job	i had i <unk> had uh two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job uh different jobs
job	job	you just you expect it to do its its job
job	job	and james woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop
job	job	and uh so when we are doing <unk> and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
job	job	because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know
job	job	my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that
job	job	i had a terrific job really enjoyed it
job	job	uh i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job
job	job	thirty years ago i i had a college job uh working as a programmer
job	job	and uh i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far
job	job	and that s made a difference in the way i do my job because it s so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things even when they <unk> on another continent
job	job	and he got a job down there
job	job	oh a teaching job
job	job	and you can not get a job because of it
job	job	and he does a good job
job	job	they <unk> done a good job
job	job	i think they did a real good job of that
job	job	and uh he just quit a perfectly good job and came
job	job	uh i know what i m seeing here at m my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they <unk> establishing careers
job	job	course my job was such that i did n't i could n't do it as much as i wanted
job	job	and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that s their problem
job	job	i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh
job	job	i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh
job	job	my job kind of hinders me from exercising
job	job	and uh then you d be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children
job	job	for sixteen bucks they <unk> not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do a f you know good a job as i can do but they <unk> uh <unk> too
job	job	and you expect them to do their job
job	job	they seem to have done a the good job in the past
job	job	so everything s changed so much i probably could n't even get a job right now
job	job	so i do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
job	job	and i told him he s going to have to get a part time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat
job	job	i m just happy still to have a job
job	job	uh on my job we had a lot of workmen s comp cases
job	job	and hopefully get a job after that
job	job	because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and did n't get the job
job	job	it begins to make you wonder why we did n't go ahead and go on in and finish the job while we were in there
job	job	uh it is just a job
job	job	as to a company s benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job
job	job	an it an i feel bad for the policeman because he s out there every day facing these people this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job
job	job	but then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
job	job	but my job i m an e d p auditor
job	job	uh sometimes too it s used as a dumb job
job	job	i also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise
job	job	i agree with that because i know personally myself i <unk> been in the same job for three years
job	job	well still taking care of the children is a very important job
job	job	but in my job i m a nurse
job	job	and they <unk> and they <unk> doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility
job	job	but they they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories
job	job	but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible you know and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors
job	job	and my job was mostly the woodwork
job	job	so i <unk> school and said hey let s you know find a place that has a nice job
job	job	probably the the biggest problem with those is they do n't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol
job	job	you know uh as you <unk> talking like police and stuff like that it s definitely a tough job to do
job	job	but uh i guess my job change my husband s job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
job	job	but uh i guess my job change my husband s job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
job	job	but uh still i i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a <unk> up job
job	job	but what i found is that they had a brake job
job	job	we know what a job it s going to be
job	job	uh i guess there s more women in uh what would be classified as a man s job
job	job	because i think that i think he did a good job
job	job	and all on the job too
job	job	so so you would have a job with a company rather than uh radio or television or newspapers or what have you
job	job	and um um but you know if you have the type of job
job	job	i m like i <unk> get a job some day
job	job	and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that
job	job	and i got the job that i wanted by applying the the methods that that
job	job	oh boy what a good job he had
job	job	um i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job
job	job	um i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job
job	job	you really do n't want to dress up unless you you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that
job	job	and if we get have a if we could have a thirty two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job
job	job	they both do the same kind of job
job	job	well their job is to be reelected by in large
job	job	uh ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center
job	job	but i just do n't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
job	job	uh my job is i m supervisor of personnel safety for the world s largest paint company
job	job	and just recently i <unk> changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
job	job	i have a sedentary job
job	job	because i was actually applying for a job in texas
job	job	and i think they do a real good job
job	job	and then you say that s not my job
job	job	and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job <unk> well unless
job	job	and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job <unk> well unless
job	job	they <unk> doing a real good job of uh separating it here
job	job	like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or
job	job	uh you either need a job
job	job	i had a part time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six
job	job	but again it depends on what job you <unk> in
job	job	and uh i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know
job	job	now my job s good much better than a lot because i m chapter one
job	job	i think there is still some discrimination there where as you know men and women work in the same job
job	job	and i feel very strongly about uh children and uh developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year where we certainly proved that we <unk> not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most
job	job	boy he just sits down eight hours a day just like any other job
job	job	i think with what they have to work with i think they <unk> doing a pretty good job right now
job	job	well i bet you there s a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
job	job	but that s basically my job
job	job	and he just got a new job
job	job	if you <unk> using it while at a job i can see a problem
job	job	uh while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a and a job i guess uh <unk> list i had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that
job	job	and you <unk> not doing your job
job	job	they just stay in their current job
job	job	and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know
job	job	i think it s called a job
job	job	and for me this is the first job i <unk> had where they <unk> covered that much
job	job	and sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like well i <unk> done a good job because i got worked myself to that point
job	job	i just started a new job
job	job	well that s he s got a job there
job	job	an and it looks like hopefully she <unk> do a nice job uh for washington you know which is
job	job	and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
job	job	i bet that s a interesting job
job	job	i m already on my job
job	job	he would wear it if he had to for his job and all
job	job	see this is n't a subject that i think a lot about because i m never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
job	job	if you do test positive for something they will give you an <unk> o opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job
job	job	i made that mistake when i first got a job
job	job	my next door neighbor just lost his job in a you know one of these uh
job	job	i i think kevin <unk> did a really good job with it
job	job	so i i m pretty much limited to p b s which i thought i thought they did a very good job
job	job	uh have you every been tested for a new job or anything
job	job	and you know it wo n't it s little job outside
job	job	so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would usually wear blue jeans and <unk> shirts and the like
job	job	or is it just a job for them
job	job	so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
job	job	what what was your job
job	job	i also have a part time job at a law firm
job	job	i <unk> uh i have worked on a part part time job uh where i was a collector for uh uh a jewelry company
job	job	and then from the other aspect um maybe the uh school itself has has has more emphasis on uh trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh
job	job	so i m going to have you know my whole job s going to be based on my clients n stuff like that
job	job	so cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree
job	job	it it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in in my job
job	job	the the job that i do i do a lot of training of our customers for new products
job	job	you you were n't supposed to want a job
job	job	so that your mom does n't have a job
job	job	and it does an excellent job
job	job	i mean that was their job as they killed in washington d c
job	job	it s a legal job you know
job	job	so trying to work myself out of a job
job	job	that s much <unk> than doing any kind of job
job	job	i think you <unk> doing a good job
job	job	and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious be curious
job	job	and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious be curious
job	job	now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small until they got in junior high school my youngest got in junior high i did n't have to work
job	job	and i i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related
job	job	and i really think they really do a wonderful job
job	job	oh i had job offers
job	job	the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company
job	job	did a pretty good job
job	job	it does the it did a good job
job	job	and they in my opinion do n't do a very responsible job of spending that money
job	job	and and now i m looking for a job before they have to send me back home
job	job	and he has done a really good job of characterizing the uh disabled person
job	job	but but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you <unk> going to make at the job
job	job	i uh i think we <unk> been doing a pretty good job you know not uh not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh
job	job	well there it s i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired
job	job	i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws
job	job	i am in a man s job
job	job	so what do you do for a job
job	job	the the job is what provides all of your needs
job	job	but i <unk> work in the job force before
job	job	are they like pretty much train for a specific job
job	job	we thought t i dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
job	job	i had it during a job interview
job	job	<unk> actually i m i m i m more interested in in in choosing the right j job when you graduate type information
job	job	um i had a job i had to go get a blood test for
job	job	but i m i m you know i m i m satisfied with my job
job	job	and she got her job back
job	job	my job at texas instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that i do n't get any exercise doing that
job	job	he s out of college and has a good job
job	job	wow that s a a big job
job	job	to her everything is you <unk> got to go through college you <unk> got to get a job you know
job	job	and of course i m not perfectly happy about not having a job
job	job	doing a good job of it
job	job	i read how to get the job that you wanted
job	job	you know but then when i went um for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know <unk> state
job	job	and the prosecutors do a lousy job
job	job	well does your r does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone
job	job	and if they <unk> you know if they <unk> on some kind of you know <unk> controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate them
job	job	well and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff
job	job	and so they work on that job
job	job	uh because i would think i think you know mentally uh and emotionally i think women can handle a job and every bit as well
job	job	you <unk> supposed to only want the job
job	job	but it s you know it s a pretty neat little job
job	job	uh still uh there s there s sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that
job	job	she <unk> she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor
job	job	i do n't know that their job would be at risk
job	job	and uh that s my job right now
job	job	which is too bad because you know i i feel like i do n't obviously i do n't get paid for my job
job	job	and they said well you know he they <unk> he has no job
job	job	and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said it s just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
job	job	uh you know um it it could even be done while they <unk> doing another job while they <unk> doing you know a job to make money
job	job	uh you know um it it could even be done while they <unk> doing another job while they <unk> doing you know a job to make money
job	job	and so i have a lot of job experience
job	job	if they <unk> if they <unk> not uh you know fully functional mentally while they <unk> doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to <unk> another people
job	job	well ford s done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to <unk> six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um
job	job	i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that
job	job	they may be able to to give the resources that s needed to uh to do a good job
job	job	and it it is possible that you know that they ca n't do as good a job uh as they might do
job	job	but it s still it s almost like a job
job	job	do you like the job sharing
job	job	course it s a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today
job	job	because i liked my job really well
job	job	you know the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they <unk> going to be there
job	job	i think they did a pretty good job
job	job	i think maybe we <unk> given our teachers a almost impossible job
job	job	also with uh women in the work force they <unk> gotten a lot more options as far as you know what s it called job sharing
job	job	do n't have a job
job	job	uh you find out one way or another if somebody s got a problem on the job
job	job	do you like your job
job	job	and you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know
job	job	i think they <unk> doing real good job
job	job	they <unk> going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it s a woman s job or a man s job but because it s dirty and it needs to be clean
job	job	they <unk> going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it s a woman s job or a man s job but because it s dirty and it needs to be clean
job	job	actually it had been uh it would have been it had been a repaint job
job	job	it did n't cause her any problems with her job
job	job	and i bet in your your job that you have to
job	job	my husband just got a new job
job	job	in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties <unk> is keeping a job until you retire
job	job	<unk> we decided not to get the <unk> which is actually another <unk> one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
job	job	but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of job
job	job	it s strong enough for any job where you do n't try to take more than say three <unk> of an inch at a time
job	job	uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job
job	job	i just made my first job hop about eight months ago
job	job	that s one thing they do n't do is is drug testing while you <unk> on the job
job	job	you know and you hear so many stories listening to them like uh you know they lost their job
job	job	the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you <unk> going to be uh rewarding people who <unk> been doing a lousy job and instead of getting the uh improvement that we want
job	job	i have a daughter who just had a second job
job	job	and i considered it a full time job
job	job	and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
job	job	so they did do a good job
job	job	i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities
job	job	they are doing such a fine fine job
job	job	would n't that be awful if you were if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything
job	job	i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
job	job	and i do n't really get out a lot to because my job to to exercise
job	job	and i get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does
job	job	well i should probably get back to my job
job	job	but i think in between we got a group of kids a generation of kids who did n't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad did n't move in to fill the gap
job	job	but that s for my husband s job and not mine
job	job	they just they they are doing such a terrific job back there
job	job	that s not my job
job	job	get a real job full time
job	job	i uh i left t i in january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money
job	job	the the n f l draft really seems to be doing its job
job	job	he took one for for uh <unk> for job hiring
job	job	and if they would just say oh this person s drug test is positive we wo n't hire them you know then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything
job	job	and and if it s not mom then then dad or somebody s got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
job	job	and like you i listened to radio on my job at work
job	job	but and i <unk> been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it
job	job	i would never in a million years want that job
job	job	i mean i have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
jesus	jesus	so you know even even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh jesus said the money in the fish s mouth or in the fisher inside the fish
aged	aged	well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged
aged	aged	and i aged ten years
aged	aged	we we <unk> very similarly aged
abuse	abuse_nou	it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond
abuse	abuse_nou	i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and uh pay and exhaustion and you know things like that rather than these uh uh really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
abuse	abuse_nou	right now some of the things i m working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse
abuse	abuse_nou	that sounds like a little abuse of our system
abuse	abuse_nou	well the thing i really worry about is uh the sexual abuse cases you read about
abuse	abuse_nou	it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
abuse	abuse_nou	and and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed because it s subject to abuse
abuse	abuse_nou	and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that
abuse	abuse_vrb	and they abuse that
abuse	abuse_vrb	and they <unk> they do n't you know they do n't go out and abuse drugs
abuse	abuse_vrb	i think it s time we had a lady abuse the guys movie
abuse	abuse_vrb	when you <unk> young you you can abuse your your all your systems
abuse	abuse_vrb	with all this do n't hurt the kids and do n't abuse their rights you <unk> also taken something away from the discipline i think
affect	affect	i do n't know how that s going to affect uh
affect	affect	i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably do n't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
affect	affect	especially the democratic candidates do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point
affect	affect	but i think just a lot of times if we do n't then then it then that influence will affect our country too for one
affect	affect	well you know like other things if they do n't affect you you do n't worry about them too much
affect	affect	and you know that s going to that s going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
affiliate	affiliate_nou	and i do n't know what affiliate of <unk> <unk> you have up there
elaborate	elaborate_adj	and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals
elaborate	elaborate_adj	well that s why chuck i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you did n't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
elaborate	elaborate_adj	well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it
elaborate	elaborate_adj	it s not a uh a uh real elaborate local area network
elaborate	elaborate_adj	so you know they would be pretty elaborate
appropriate	appropriate_adj	uh but then when you <unk> things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that
appropriate	appropriate_adj	so well this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day
appropriate	appropriate_adj	uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes
appropriate	appropriate_adj	but i think i think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board
appropriate	appropriate_adj	or you have highway signs saying speed limit uh eighty eighty five whatever would be the appropriate number
appropriate	appropriate_adj	very appropriate i guess
appropriate	appropriate_adj	what what do you think is uh is an appropriate uh punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that
appropriate	appropriate_adj	well i m not real sure that s that s appropriate
appropriate	appropriate_adj	we thought t i dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
appropriate	appropriate_adj	uh so that uh a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day
appropriate	appropriate_adj	and naturally this is appropriate because i m planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night
associate	associate_vrb	i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see over at the medical school
associate	associate_adj-nou	a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
attribute	attribute_vrb	and you ca n't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
object	object_vrb	because i ca n't really see why anyone um who has nothing to hide would object
object	object_vrb	i would not object if anybody did
object	object_vrb	the one thing i do object to about rap music is is when it becomes militant or if it s uh violence oriented
excuse	excuse_nou	i do n't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent <unk> uh you know reason to not use capital punishment
excuse	excuse_nou	i think it s an excuse to do nothing
excuse	excuse_nou	and i kind of use that as an excuse
excuse	excuse_nou	but that is an excuse and that would i could live with
excuse	excuse_nou	i do n't know if that s an excuse for not having a tight budget
excuse	excuse_nou	well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is unfortunate for that person and yet should n't be an excuse
excuse	excuse_nou	if you <unk> busy that has always been a legitimate excuse
excuse	excuse_nou	you hear this as an excuse
excuse	excuse_nou	they there is no excuse
excuse	excuse_nou	what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting
excuse	excuse_nou	but my <unk> is my excuse for not exercising
excuse	excuse_nou	i think that s a good excuse
excuse	excuse_nou	it s always easy to find an excuse not to exercise
excuse	excuse_nou	i think you <unk> right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too
excuse	excuse_nou	and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me
excuse	excuse_vrb	excuse me
excuse	excuse_vrb	as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid excuse me my parents used to have
excuse	excuse_vrb	and they <unk> not going to excuse people if it was was run like that
excuse	excuse_vrb	excuse me
excuse	excuse_vrb	excuse me it sounds like we both have colds
excuse	excuse_vrb	excuse me
excuse	excuse_vrb	especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months
excuse	excuse_vrb	or excuse me the ninety <unk>
excuse	excuse_vrb	a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment
excuse	excuse_vrb	just based on the sheer numbers of uh the disparity of excuse me democrats and republicans in congress he d think that it would have to have been um
excuse	excuse_vrb	well course there s a a tremendous number of refrigerators and <unk> excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing <unk> twelve
excuse	excuse_vrb	j r my my my last son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with washington state
excuse	excuse_vrb	but you can see the thunder and excuse me see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth
excuse	excuse_vrb	but it did n't excuse me it did n't uh uh it just did n't look as smooth as i wanted it to
excuse	excuse_vrb	the times we <unk> seen it it s been like on <unk> or excuse me friday night
excuse	excuse_vrb	uh huh well excuse me i uh uh well i m a technician electronics tech
excuse	excuse_vrb	well excuse me just second
excuse	excuse_vrb	oh oh excuse me
excuse	excuse_vrb	it s uh uh i guess excuse me just a standard
expose	expose_vrb	and i thought this would expose both of them to what it s you know like on a <unk> a smaller college campus
increase	increase_vrb	i think your patient level must needs to increase as the child gets older
increase	increase_vrb	and that actually um as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population that s the problem
increase	increase_vrb	and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is uh if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship
increase	increase_vrb	and i am making every effort to to put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need for a down payment or whatever
increase	increase_vrb	and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit
increase	increase_vrb	people would rather uh increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them
increase	increase_vrb	and that s probably going to increase you know
invalid	invalid_adj	they kept saying you have the invalid code
invite	invite_vrb	was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite
invite	invite_vrb	was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite
invite	invite_vrb	and nor and they <unk> doing something that normally i really only invite people to
estimate	estimate_nou	and uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate
frequent	frequent_adj	and uh we we were a little bit too frequent i think
frequent	frequent_adj	and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles
frequent	frequent_adj	women are n't nearly as frequent
frequent	frequent_adj	so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when they <unk> not expecting it
graduate	graduate_vrb	uh i have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college
graduate	graduate_vrb	but so how long ago did you graduate
graduate	graduate_vrb	so uh uh you know did you graduate from purdue
graduate	graduate_vrb	and one of the plano school district s you know goals is that they will graduate every child that uh that is here in the ninth grade
graduate	graduate_vrb	and what did you graduate in
graduate	graduate_vrb	uh we just came back from uh uh grand rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate from uh with his master s degree in social work
graduate	graduate_vrb	but uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read
graduate	graduate_vrb	uh as a course for p e you know so i could graduate
graduate	graduate_vrb	<unk> actually i m i m i m more interested in in in choosing the right j job when you graduate type information
graduate	graduate_vrb	i m about to graduate from college
graduate	graduate_vrb	and it said that uh like thirty four percent of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program
graduate	graduate_vrb	i plan on getting back once i graduate next weekend
graduate	graduate_vrb	did you graduate in a certain field
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	i m a graduate student
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little sports car racing
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	and now i i i uh started out when i first got in graduate school i was going into public administration
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	i m a graduate student
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	he is uh an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his p h d
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	i m a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	and my husband started graduate school when we were first married
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	um i <unk> found that when i i do n't have cable television anymore uh when i moved went back to graduate school i just did n't have the money to buy <unk> rent a cable t v line or whatever you know
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	um you know when i first was applying for graduate schools i applied to some big programs you know in this area like stevens institute of technology which is recognized in the northeast as as you know one step below m i t in a sense you know
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	and twenty years ago i was uh in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though i m in graduate school uh
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	i m a graduate student
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	and now i m going to school part time and uh graduate school
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	when i when dick and i were oh many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in missouri um i went oh
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	you know but then when i went um for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know <unk> state
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	i m a student i m a graduate student
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	i m a graduate student at u c f in florida university of central florida
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	and i think that that s the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know that that it was worth it to save and to not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	as soon as you <unk> a graduate student they get your name
house	house_nou	our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies
house	house_nou	you know there s a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it
house	house_nou	so we moved into this house in garland
house	house_nou	and he said he s had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to <unk> keep him quiet
house	house_nou	they <unk> they <unk> stock your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there
house	house_nou	what color did you paint your house
house	house_nou	we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house
house	house_nou	and at the end of the day your house still feels like it s a mess
house	house_nou	i rotate around uh about four different routes uh from my house
house	house_nou	oh that s the that s the one where they burn down the house or something
house	house_nou	you go into the coffee house
house	house_nou	we did n't know that when we bought the house
house	house_nou	and i called back to the house
house	house_nou	and it s it it the house is forty years old
house	house_nou	well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room you know
house	house_nou	the house explodes
house	house_nou	you ca n't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they <unk> got to be careful
house	house_nou	are they um just house pets
house	house_nou	that was one of the requirements from you know f h a that the house be painted before we bought it
house	house_nou	i m building my own house
house	house_nou	oh there s enough to put oh i d say uh what twelve feet between each house on each side
house	house_nou	it started out life as a three bedroom house and now has no two car garage and has uh the two extra rooms enclosed
house	house_nou	and and <unk> the relationship between the family is is really now now the mother in law lives in the house with them
house	house_nou	we bought a a large house that was completely <unk>
house	house_nou	in a new house everything is white
house	house_nou	and he <unk> the house
house	house_nou	and we did basically seventy five percent of the house
house	house_nou	but my husband s got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything
house	house_nou	and i think that is probably what happened in our house
house	house_nou	we <unk> in a house
house	house_nou	we have a neighborhood watch program in the house uh the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce uh home theft burglary and things of that sort
house	house_nou	are your rooms in your house bigger since it s a sixties home
house	house_nou	this part of the country actually they say that when the house is uh fifteen it s already old
house	house_nou	uh i know in my case i my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five
house	house_nou	i mean there if you do n't live in a house that s at least seventy five to hundred years old you know you <unk> just nobody practically
house	house_nou	and we had thought before maybe a lot older we do n't need such a large house that we <unk> sell it
house	house_nou	was was the house reasonably new
house	house_nou	we have a new one in the house
house	house_nou	well you know with kids you <unk> not going to have a neat house
house	house_nou	well good luck in your house hunting
house	house_nou	two family house where the the um the downstairs and the second floor they had
house	house_nou	so if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you <unk> come out paying a uh one month extra every year
house	house_nou	and even even though my wife was n't working we did have uh one or another of the boys in uh child care for part <unk> just for part of the day uh or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on
house	house_nou	because the house has so many windows
house	house_nou	we <unk> having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us
house	house_nou	but unfortunately the house is taking up my time
house	house_nou	and i <unk> tell you uh we we had kind of a charming house
house	house_nou	we did some remodeling when we bought a house
house	house_nou	i <unk> been in the house i m in here right now about twelve and a half years
house	house_nou	um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife s boss a couple weeks ago
house	house_nou	let s say compared to maryland that same house here would probably cost three quarters of a million dollars
house	house_nou	we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there
house	house_nou	and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse
house	house_nou	as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a t v or a big item like for the house
house	house_nou	and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature dachshund
house	house_nou	and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh <unk> did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games
house	house_nou	he s been pretty good because there s t shirt stuff all over the house
house	house_nou	so you can afford to get a house
house	house_nou	so i put them outside once i got a house
house	house_nou	we have a computer here at the house
house	house_nou	but um we this is the first house we <unk> ever lived in
house	house_nou	so i refuse to have one in the house
house	house_nou	but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
house	house_nou	but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i want it kept it is hard
house	house_nou	well our house in new mexico it was stucco
house	house_nou	i m going do n't do that because they wo n't come in my house
house	house_nou	well do you use your computer for um just things around the house or in the <unk>
house	house_nou	so i would uh not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in uh because they <unk> <unk> uh
house	house_nou	they do n't get out of the house
house	house_nou	and uh nowadays the latest thing i <unk> i <unk> read about in the paper here that they <unk> doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house
house	house_nou	we had built a deck on the back of that house
house	house_nou	and within uh two months he has all his house payments gone everything paid you know
house	house_nou	you know you just do n't buy a house
house	house_nou	and i have two string instruments in my house uh instrument players
house	house_nou	and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house
house	house_nou	it s a nice house
house	house_nou	and um so since the house did burn they <unk> they <unk> going
house	house_nou	well charles will actually charles will not smoke in anyone else s house except our own
house	house_nou	we moved in here may this house may of last year
house	house_nou	and uh the house is built around the trees
house	house_nou	i mean you know there s no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows
house	house_nou	well can you tell me anything else about the house
house	house_nou	and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know
house	house_nou	uh we <unk> got a house
house	house_nou	the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
house	house_nou	and that was one of the main <unk> that we have about buying a house
house	house_nou	um i m making drapes for my house just because i m
house	house_nou	and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
house	house_nou	so i i have a rifle in the house
house	house_nou	i mean it looked darker to him because he he was in the house with the lights on
house	house_nou	you know that s one reason we bought a house here in plano
house	house_nou	well are you going to paint the outside of your house too
house	house_nou	i do n't think that many by the builder that built this house
house	house_nou	ours um ours barks more than um than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house
house	house_nou	both times they were at our house
house	house_nou	just wait for you to drive to your house
house	house_nou	i have n't i have n't i have yet to see a basement in a house
house	house_nou	a house or something
house	house_nou	and she stays in the house all day while i go to work
house	house_nou	do you own your house
house	house_nou	so is your house in an area by itself
house	house_nou	and they do n't have to do anything around the house
house	house_nou	that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week s worth of trash for a house
house	house_nou	and you know we <unk> trying to decide what what to what to put on one side of the house and things like that
house	house_nou	so not pizza inn but pizza to our house
house	house_nou	and it s been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house
house	house_nou	we started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
house	house_nou	thing is we <unk> uh the main thing that we <unk> had with this house recently has been some uh squirming i call it of the foundation
house	house_nou	but i guess you just tend to think of of where your house is you know and nothing else
house	house_nou	but in the house itself i <unk> been working inside you know these <unk> these many months
house	house_nou	what do you call a uh double ceiling double high in one half of the house
house	house_nou	<unk> we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house
house	house_nou	we just moved into a new house too
house	house_nou	when i was single we used to always cook around the house
house	house_nou	we <unk> looking at buying a house
house	house_nou	but the the problem that we <unk> we <unk> owned this house almost five years now
house	house_nou	my son leaves the house at seven thirty and does n't get home until three o'clock
house	house_nou	my mother had a piano in the in the house
house	house_nou	we had the house built
house	house_nou	and i renovated a house there
house	house_nou	so what is your house like
house	house_nou	and the cities are very populated with tenement housing where there are more than one family in a house
house	house_nou	which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected
house	house_nou	and it s a brick house with uh some wood
house	house_nou	the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you ca n't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways
house	house_nou	and our house is not
house	house_nou	and we bought a house
house	house_nou	we <unk> got we <unk> got all the different lake editions around the house
house	house_nou	well uh we just bought our house uh last july
house	house_nou	and uh uh a house full of snow
house	house_nou	um he does it believe it or not i would n't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife
house	house_nou	and they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something
house	house_nou	you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know house
house	house_nou	what kind of house do you live in
house	house_nou	we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular t v that we watched we had to watch an hour of public t v
house	house_nou	and it s a brick house
house	house_nou	that s not near like building a house or anything
house	house_nou	well i i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere
house	house_nou	we have we have a soccer field that s um oh about a hundred yards from our house
house	house_nou	uh i do n't live in a house
house	house_nou	they sell their house
house	house_nou	a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house
house	house_nou	and it seemed like the further i got away from dallas center uh the more lot came with the house and and the lower the price at the same time
house	house_nou	but that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to uh <unk> i guess to buy his paint
house	house_nou	so that way i did n't think <unk> you know the house would be <unk> you know cleaned or anything for me specifically
house	house_nou	um do the skunk uh was it kind of like a cat to have around the house
house	house_nou	and uh she s cleaning house
house	house_nou	the house that house that i bought is close to a <unk> golf course
house	house_nou	the house that house that i bought is close to a <unk> golf course
house	house_nou	we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago
house	house_nou	and it takes them something like thirty days to complete a house
house	house_nou	but as far as a habit at the house uh i have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up
house	house_nou	and his mom just wanted a a new house you know
house	house_nou	and uh i did n't really start getting into music until i went to college because uh my parents did n't really have music in the house
house	house_nou	and i do n't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them
house	house_nou	and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were <unk> what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house
house	house_nou	and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were <unk> what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house
house	house_nou	and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were <unk> what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house
house	house_nou	i m going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is
house	house_nou	so we <unk> spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um like to keep up to date too
house	house_nou	i just see him as trying to squish as much space you know as much house into the space as possible
house	house_nou	it s this house built on on a waterfall
house	house_nou	and when we move that s one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a uh garden
house	house_nou	and a house full of snow and rain
house	house_nou	our house is kind of on a little hill
house	house_nou	i mean you know there would be one person who lived there that would have a house
house	house_nou	i guess when i was growing up it was it was still the ideal to get a get a home and buy house
house	house_nou	we just bought the house last year
house	house_nou	and uh um it was a real excitement to uh to go out and select the house and have one made and built and like you wanted it
house	house_nou	but uh uh the uh the local taxes here i i i in this particular area uh you know i <unk> uh i think i pay about uh oh thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know and which is a lot of money
house	house_nou	we we also my wife and i uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that s just a mile from our house
house	house_nou	and it got so much that she could not take care of her house
house	house_nou	what else do you do to your house
house	house_nou	so when we <unk> invited to people s house he will not smoke in their house which i think is good because there s a lot of people that are very
house	house_nou	so when we <unk> invited to people s house he will not smoke in their house which i think is good because there s a lot of people that are very
house	house_nou	they are they are house cats
house	house_nou	first house
house	house_nou	and we <unk> getting a house
house	house_nou	i <unk> been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
house	house_nou	but on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together
house	house_nou	well because i know our our little house over here stuck in the middle of you know the subdivision is i think fifty five
house	house_nou	it s a house
house	house_nou	it was a cedar shake house and very weathered
house	house_nou	well what are the colors in your house
house	house_nou	by your house
house	house_nou	but on the east side of the house it runs fine
house	house_nou	i am wanting <unk> i want blue and purple and you know just different shades of that because my my house is gray
house	house_nou	that s pretty new house yet
house	house_nou	and it s a three bedroom two bath house
house	house_nou	you know actually we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles
house	house_nou	does he sleep in your house
house	house_nou	and they had all their stuff from their house
house	house_nou	well we usually start them right in the house
house	house_nou	we um i m presently living in a house uh
house	house_nou	and i had called back to the house
house	house_nou	luckily i came from a house in colorado which had the cathedral ceiling
house	house_nou	so it s just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents
house	house_nou	on the other side of the house though that s where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums
house	house_nou	and when we um put out house in um they wanted us to have
house	house_nou	but they <unk> a cheap house
house	house_nou	i mean i i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house
house	house_nou	and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house
house	house_nou	i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house
house	house_nou	and so he has a big landing area that s between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on
house	house_nou	it s tough to find a five and six room bedroom house is n't it
house	house_nou	but we have several guns around the house
house	house_nou	my parents in new york had uh a uh three family house
house	house_nou	and and some odd stuff around the house
house	house_nou	now when they go to their grandmother s house which is every weekend it s a it s a different a different story all around
house	house_nou	well your was your house in good shape
house	house_nou	it s it s a house
house	house_nou	but i have an ex i had an exercise bike in the house but did n't seem to use it enough
house	house_nou	a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house
house	house_nou	the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i
house	house_nou	the house that i used to live in had one bath and a half
house	house_nou	are are you in a house
house	house_nou	i mean it s not an eldorado house or anything like that
house	house_nou	they landscape their whole house with flower gardens
house	house_nou	but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just e essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly uh certainly have <unk> <unk> are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on
house	house_nou	we invariably end up at my house since i <unk> got two kids
house	house_nou	uh out near my house is pretty hilly
house	house_nou	about maybe oh close to a year ago now i guess i i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
house	house_nou	we have a brick house
house	house_nou	well you know you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
house	house_nou	see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that that we do as far as the the materials
house	house_nou	my my parents in law they <unk> they <unk> building a house into the side of a hill um
house	house_nou	i mean do you think people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs
house	house_nou	in my <unk> they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a <unk> a child in a house
house	house_nou	um you <unk> got an older house
house	house_nou	we <unk> uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids
house	house_nou	after they <unk> been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house
house	house_nou	because our house payment is once a month
house	house_nou	we <unk> got power surges on the west side of our house
house	house_nou	and so it just sort of echoes through the house
house	house_nou	this house was built in seventy four
house	house_nou	and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house
house	house_nou	i d like to have one for the house too
house	house_nou	because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet
house	house_nou	we had a lovely little house over there
house	house_nou	we wound up selling the house
house	house_nou	and there s no other real shut off valves inside the house
house	house_nou	well um my parents house is like three miles south of where the <unk> line would have hit the ohio river had it continued that far
house	house_nou	mostly just stuff that i can you know use right around the house or give away as gifts
house	house_nou	all four of ours are house cats
house	house_nou	so i got a g my gun and walked to the you know through the house into the garage
house	house_nou	whenever we have at the big get together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce
house	house_nou	um my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things uh his resume his uh letter
house	house_nou	i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening some
house	house_nou	oh is is that what you usually use in the house is latex
house	house_nou	and we undertook a building house
house	house_nou	i happened to go to just a little estate sale that just a little white frame house where the couple uh was very old and had gone into nursing homes
house	house_nou	and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house
house	house_nou	but the one thing my house is a little bit different
house	house_nou	and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you
house	house_nou	but uh he built us a house
house	house_nou	and that got her out of the house
house	house_nou	well i can see you know especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous
house	house_nou	but uh always cats in the house
house	house_nou	well our daughter and son in law moved up back up here he s from texas but course she s from here uh about a year and a half ago and had their house on the market down there
house	house_nou	what kind of roof does your house have
house	house_nou	or get into a house with a little more space
house	house_nou	my current project is a walkway which i m building around the house and out to the backyard to uh you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh <unk> on top of that
house	house_nou	and when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that
house	house_nou	i live in plano in a four bedroom two bath house which is
house	house_nou	we do n't have concrete slab underneath our house
house	house_nou	i live in a in a town house which is you know
house	house_nou	we just moved to a new <unk> into a house
house	house_nou	i mean you can see the house from you know miles away
house	house_nou	well that s nice that it s not in your house
house	house_nou	well we <unk> got at least two windows on every wall in the house
house	house_nou	after we had the house part made we just decided we d carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a <unk> more or less
house	house_nou	and he walked around the house with his <unk> face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he would n't let anybody pull it
house	house_nou	we had a house and a home and
house	house_nou	but my dad uh my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house
house	house_nou	and uh what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment
house	house_nou	we just my wife and i just recently moved into our house
house	house_nou	but a p c at the house would really take a lot of the load off
house	house_nou	and i go to a <unk> a campus of the university of maryland that is just less than a mile from my house
house	house_nou	were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house
house	house_nou	or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on l o a to have her baby we hooked up uh uh a terminal at her house
house	house_nou	and she s going to buy her house
house	house_nou	at thirty three hundred dollars or thirty five hundred dollars i m paying in taxes why i i could go down to <unk> and probably rent a rent a house for that right
house	house_nou	and and uh kind of strange because i it s not unusual to uh see uh an engineering manual or something laying around the house
house	house_nou	and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house
house	house_nou	a a it s a bedroom and a walk in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
house	house_nou	and the lights shine right at our house
house	house_nou	and uh you know there s certain spots in the house where he likes to go
house	house_nou	and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house
house	house_nou	our house is very old also
house	house_nou	being born outside you did n't have any problems house training him
house	house_nou	lot of people will buy in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the or do something
house	house_nou	i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue which i would not would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color with little purple spots that it it will fade into a solid purple
house	house_nou	and uh it s about a five year old house now
house	house_nou	right now our house does n't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there
house	house_nou	b on my house
house	house_nou	our whole house is baseball fans
house	house_nou	when when our kids were small we had a couple of uh good good women who uh would often c uh get them to come to the house
house	house_nou	what does that house got attraction
house	house_nou	if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or a car
house	house_nou	so you know you really ca n't afford i i i could never afford a house inside the <unk>
house	house_nou	they <unk> they <unk> uh it s like a little house except the whole face is open
house	house_nou	they just there in that house
house	house_nou	now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it
house	house_nou	and i i do n't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
house	house_nou	so that was really worth it painting his own house
house	house_nou	our house when i when i was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house
house	house_nou	our house when i when i was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house
house	house_nou	the house is about um i d say almost thirty years old
house	house_nou	i <unk> got a storm door on the front of the house
house	house_nou	but in mine the wintertime it s not bad too because then i <unk> got a a fireplace and a nice nice house and all that
house	house_nou	my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den
house	house_nou	someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i do n't have
house	house_nou	oh it s uh it looks like a little shot gun house almost
house	house_nou	and the garages were always if the house <unk> was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have
house	house_nou	in a big city like that most houses i would think would be sort of like what we live in just a you know basic tract house
house	house_nou	but all the trim around the house was uh
house	house_nou	and uh it was quite a drag because um we got them in our house
house	house_nou	you should have one in the in the in the house
house	house_nou	well what about the trim in your house
house	house_nou	there was not there s not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day
house	house_nou	and um their house is going to be really big
house	house_nou	and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything
house	house_nou	but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it it had sat empty for the better part of a year
house	house_nou	and we have a three bedroom house
house	house_nou	so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house
house	house_nou	we painted the house to uh
house	house_nou	you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
house	house_nou	my my wife and i we planted on the on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias
house	house_nou	and this was a a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions
house	house_nou	in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half
house	house_nou	so she told us that the house had been uh professionally painted recently
house	house_nou	so it s got real high ceilings on half the house
house	house_nou	but no one is just welcome to come by my house
house	house_nou	and that s just like a mile or two from our house
house	house_nou	but as far as the costs for what you <unk> getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it
house	house_nou	well d now does your cat sleep in the house
house	house_nou	do you have a lot of shade trees around your house
house	house_nou	because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it
house	house_nou	i where i live is a house that s seventeen years old when i bought it
house	house_nou	well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also
house	house_nou	and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
house	house_nou	but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house
house	house_nou	and and i you know i still provide most of the things that go on around the house
house	house_nou	you can have the house alarm uh neighborhood watch program you know uh as a woman not go out at night
house	house_nou	but i think they should also respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
house	house_nou	and even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but i ca n't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know
house	house_nou	well i took a lot of time in choosing this site because the the house has no heating or air conditioning
house	house_nou	they know the house is unlocked
house	house_nou	so uh it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that s just you know a very square little box
house	house_nou	it may be eighty two because we bought our house in eighty one
house	house_nou	anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home
house	house_nou	your house sounds like mine because mine s pier and beam too
house	house_nou	if you had two people that do n't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house
house	house_nou	i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done
house	house_nou	and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls
house	house_nou	does she ever mess in the house
house	house_nou	and uh she s been holding herself pretty well the uh up until you know recently where she s been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
house	house_nou	and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
house	house_nou	it was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned
house	house_nou	well we went over to her house
house	house_nou	it s a pier beam house
house	house_nou	and these and these people may in fact be just looking to s find an unoccupied house to rob
house	house_nou	well it s to protect the the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
house	house_nou	on a on a on a what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in pensacola florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes
house	house_nou	on a on a on a what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in pensacola florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes
house	house_nou	on a on a on a what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in pensacola florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes
house	house_nou	they <unk> rob one house
house	house_nou	and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
house	house_nou	i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built
house	house_nou	you mean you do n't need to wear little old house dresses any more
house	house_nou	and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there s always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh not enough to go and to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for
house	house_nou	but the the house is real small
house	house_nou	well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom
house	house_nou	i if i did it every night i think there would be trouble in our house
house	house_nou	the house that the house that i bought was really really nice
house	house_nou	the house that the house that i bought was really really nice
house	house_nou	and we <unk> building a stand uh just to the north of our house and along the east uh property line
house	house_nou	um or our breakers are n't are n't powerful enough to take to to really help with the load in the house
house	house_nou	and uh the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house
house	house_nou	and we finally got her you know house trained and everything
house	house_nou	well our house was <unk> uh
impact	impact_nou	but it s like low impact <unk> just with weights
impact	impact_nou	uh because that s a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that does n't do it that does n't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact
impact	impact_nou	um it they call it a low impact <unk>
impact	impact_nou	i would think you d make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there s there s protestors out here at the you know
impact	impact_nou	of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get i think in terms of psychological impact
impact	impact_nou	uh it s like low impact <unk>
impact	impact_nou	or you might you know if it does n't impact you directly or if your management does n't think that
impact	impact_nou	it would make a huge impact
impact	impact_nou	but it s just a shame to me that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well being
impact	impact_nou	or if they <unk> sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh impact machines or whatever you you can do that
impact	impact_nou	those <unk> classes are are tough the the high impact
impact	impact_nou	and others of them um had an impact on the society around here
impact	impact_nou	and that may impact it as well
impact	impact_nou	but then that was back when uh you know the high impact and
impact	impact_nou	but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise
impact	impact_nou	oh so the <unk> the impact would not be good
impact	impact_nou	and one of the ones that had an impact was uh people becoming interested in alternate practices
impact	impact_nou	and then i do low impact <unk>
incline	incline_nou	my treadmill has an incline
increase	increase_nou	is there going to be a ticket increase this year price
increase	increase_nou	and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the in the uh state land grant colleges which which is n't i mean
increase	increase_nou	in the last six years every year there s been at least minimum twenty five percent increase in health insurance costs
increase	increase_nou	it s it s hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to a logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying a guns you <unk> not going to have an increase in gunfire
invite	invite_nou	so we just have to either or give a formal invite
instrument	instrument_nou	and i have two string instruments in my house uh instrument players
instrument	instrument_nou	uh do you play any instrument yourself
instrument	instrument_nou	do you have a favorite instrument
instrument	instrument_nou	uh probably the favorite instrument would be uh the violin
instrument	instrument_nou	i m i <unk> never played an instrument in my life
intimate	intimate_adj	it s not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins
use	use_nou	but you you got the use out of it
use	use_nou	and so we <unk> found good use for those
use	use_nou	and uh what what it involves basically is the use of peer groups
use	use_nou	it s about six months of no use
use	use_nou	it s good to get use out of one
use	use_nou	my do n't get very much use
use	use_nou	well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you do n't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash
use	use_nou	so uh i m i have n't made use of that
use	use_nou	so that s a very regular use of it that she has
use	use_nou	uh the the little use that i <unk> gotten from my router i would say uh i would spend my money on the bits
use	use_nou	you do n't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use
use	use_nou	and it s the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns uh
use	use_nou	but if they were careful they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
use	use_nou	and all wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
use	use_nou	and and so uh but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that
use	use_nou	well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor
use	use_nou	it s for drug use
use	use_nou	it says use of narcotics on company premises
use	use_nou	i i i wonder if uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because i mean so many people use it
use	use_nou	i i i wonder if uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because i mean so many people use it
use	use_nou	are n't do n't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their per for their pet theories or some such thing
use	use_nou	for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there s where there s uh endangerment to their own life and other people s lives
use	use_nou	i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us
use	use_nou	even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about uh three weeks of use
use	use_nou	but it could be put to more practical use
use	use_nou	that s a very good use
use	use_nou	but i was i i was staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use
use	use_nou	can you use that one for personal use
uses	uses_nou	well i know there there s got to be a lot of uses
use	use_vrb	did you like do you use credit cards
use	use_vrb	you can use chicken or turkey
use	use_vrb	we just use trail <unk>
use	use_vrb	i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use
use	use_vrb	to use you mean
use	use_vrb	but and i can use either the pro printer
use	use_vrb	uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated body of law
use	use_vrb	well we uh me and my wife when when we have like extra money that we know we <unk> going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah we <unk> we <unk> use it
use	use_vrb	course they do n't use uh points anymore
use	use_vrb	and we use a lot of two liter bottles um and like milk cartons and things like that
use	use_vrb	and then you pay that off and do n't use it until uh it s paid off
use	use_vrb	i use a few
use	use_vrb	i do n't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent <unk> uh you know reason to not use capital punishment
use	use_vrb	but you know it s like only use like one person does the work
use	use_vrb	if you <unk> going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think do n't you
use	use_vrb	if you <unk> going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think do n't you
use	use_vrb	and they can actually use as much <unk> paper as the community can get to them because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside
use	use_vrb	uh i have a few favorites that i use more than others
use	use_vrb	i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing
use	use_vrb	i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and you know uh one that i use just for emergencies
use	use_vrb	i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and you know uh one that i use just for emergencies
use	use_vrb	well uh do you uh do you ever use the a t m machines
use	use_vrb	what kind of a computer do you use at work
use	use_vrb	there s about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games
use	use_vrb	and the <unk> ones are better to use
use	use_vrb	for the average person is exactly what he can use it for
use	use_vrb	and you never really use them
use	use_vrb	and they <unk> the ones that are the tough ones to use you know
use	use_vrb	and uh uh if you <unk> going to use for a lifetime i suppose it s worth it
use	use_vrb	and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there
use	use_vrb	but i think that if i learn how to use one i would i would feel better
use	use_vrb	and i just use a two wood off the fairway
use	use_vrb	i mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent
use	use_vrb	well how many different types of packages do you use
use	use_vrb	i use them continually
use	use_vrb	and nowadays people use fed ex all the time
use	use_vrb	and they say that uh that there was <unk> that there was like a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use
use	use_vrb	i <unk> heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it
use	use_vrb	now if you use the dried kind then you would only use two of them
use	use_vrb	now if you use the dried kind then you would only use two of them
use	use_vrb	what do you use it for
use	use_vrb	but i do n't usually use a word <unk> to do it
use	use_vrb	and you ca n't use the piglets you know
use	use_vrb	for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies
use	use_vrb	and back back in those days they also use to give you uh booklets good for uh clothing and gas and things like this
use	use_vrb	the in plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content that uh uh i went to use my dad in law s tiller
use	use_vrb	i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows
use	use_vrb	can you use it like at a bank machine
use	use_vrb	and and i think it s uh just mcdonald s effort to reduce the number of of <unk> uh boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff
use	use_vrb	uh but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that
use	use_vrb	i guess probably the factors we d use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and safety and then mileage
use	use_vrb	i just do n't know if i d have the time to use it
use	use_vrb	people still use it enough in like in towns like clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate
use	use_vrb	and it s one that we use in our work
use	use_vrb	so mine are you know i use mine for recreation
use	use_vrb	i still think it s sort of true that a more civilized society would n't have to use capital punishment
use	use_vrb	now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can
use	use_vrb	have you ever used do you use <unk> ever have you ever used <unk>
use	use_vrb	well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own
use	use_vrb	do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper
use	use_vrb	do you use it a lot at home
use	use_vrb	but i do n't use it anymore
use	use_vrb	you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know
use	use_vrb	we i guess we we use the coupons too
use	use_vrb	and i kind of use that as an excuse
use	use_vrb	i <unk> heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition
use	use_vrb	and now i use it twice a year maybe
use	use_vrb	if you <unk> not going to use them then you want to be in in environment
use	use_vrb	well do you use your computer for um just things around the house or in the <unk>
use	use_vrb	people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use
use	use_vrb	it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy
use	use_vrb	i mean somewhere there s it s lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter <unk> that if you know
use	use_vrb	and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning
use	use_vrb	that s the way i use them uh
use	use_vrb	i think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and fleas
use	use_vrb	i use to work at <unk>
use	use_vrb	and i have not had to use the heat
use	use_vrb	i just do n't know if we would really use it that much you know
use	use_vrb	they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably
use	use_vrb	the ones we use is like visa
use	use_vrb	uh i do n't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh a positive indication of drugs but there s not really there were n't really any there
use	use_vrb	and if we want well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc and carry it over to there and see if they <unk> not using the printer
use	use_vrb	i use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine
use	use_vrb	i suppose you could use that
use	use_vrb	there s been a couple of other the people uh most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are going to use data base eventually
use	use_vrb	use it as a just a
use	use_vrb	whatever s left over is disposable in disposable <unk> yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month
use	use_vrb	we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or um doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also as a just as a terminal
use	use_vrb	what do you use yours at home for
use	use_vrb	but i just do n't find the time that i can use it
use	use_vrb	i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know
use	use_vrb	but i ca n't see paying someone to use their card
use	use_vrb	and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water pull it out and there s a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what i usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him
use	use_vrb	and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water pull it out and there s a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what i usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him
use	use_vrb	so i do n't know if she s going to even use it anymore
use	use_vrb	but i do use my treadmill
use	use_vrb	so we have n't got to use it much
use	use_vrb	i could use a discount
use	use_vrb	you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know
use	use_vrb	or i <unk> got my p c <unk> to where i can use either printer the one that s on the network or my own
use	use_vrb	i find the one i use mostly uh
use	use_vrb	and oh i we use a lot of free lance
use	use_vrb	they use the money from that to fund this t i <unk> against drugs program
use	use_vrb	it is the only way that you can use television effectively
use	use_vrb	did you do did you use like uh a stamp pad and ink
use	use_vrb	but if you go for the other ones you <unk> paying too much money for them because it s unlikely if you <unk> f relatively uh healthy then it s really unlikely that you d use that much amount of money you know
use	use_vrb	i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know
use	use_vrb	they use like animated
use	use_vrb	uh i use them both here at work and at home
use	use_vrb	i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
use	use_vrb	well the there s a trick i use
use	use_vrb	i want i want something that s serviceable serviceable something that i can use
use	use_vrb	uh and i use it all day at work
use	use_vrb	well i guess i could use a card too
use	use_vrb	what do you use
use	use_vrb	otherwise you can uh guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed or can just have that money you know put in your paycheck
use	use_vrb	i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there
use	use_vrb	i guess you could use a hand mixer
use	use_vrb	you can use it like any other card
use	use_vrb	uh i m not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use is not bomb quality
use	use_vrb	did did you use it the car shop place
use	use_vrb	then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things
use	use_vrb	uh but every morning i use this president s uh council of physical fitness
use	use_vrb	mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that
use	use_vrb	i really do n't use it myself
use	use_vrb	up up at work anyway i use <unk> and lotus and and <unk> which is uh uh a a line <unk> package
use	use_vrb	and then i would provide uh use the money that we <unk> paying them to uh provide some special help in training and particularly uh mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time
use	use_vrb	but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back
use	use_vrb	well do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work
use	use_vrb	i i do n't use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know
use	use_vrb	i i do n't use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know
use	use_vrb	well what he wants to do is take all the money that uh he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education
use	use_vrb	but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh
use	use_vrb	i mean i mean n everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and you know use different words instead i think
use	use_vrb	but we use it the same way
use	use_vrb	well that s a that s a skill that she can use for the rest of her life
use	use_vrb	well do you use credit cards
use	use_vrb	you use the <unk> system
use	use_vrb	and you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know
use	use_vrb	and we use to go go out to that about once a week
use	use_vrb	do you use that facility a lot
use	use_vrb	we use uh uh a two inch brush with uh on a slant
use	use_vrb	what do you use it for
use	use_vrb	they figure that if they give you card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
use	use_vrb	i know too many people who use a calculator
use	use_vrb	i always i use everything with my visa
use	use_vrb	probably maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing i would use
use	use_vrb	well i do use them
use	use_vrb	but i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand
use	use_vrb	i do n't usually use the colors they tell me to
use	use_vrb	and i use my personal computer constantly
use	use_vrb	and they <unk> recommending that you use those because they do n't know the future of continental
use	use_vrb	and we use that sometimes
use	use_vrb	what kinds of decorations did you use with the <unk>
use	use_vrb	well we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project
use	use_vrb	but let me ask you this since you use texans
use	use_vrb	do you use p c s
use	use_vrb	but other than that we do n't use them anymore
use	use_vrb	because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out uh all the parts that you do n't want to slop over onto you do n't have to be quite as precise about how you do it
use	use_vrb	because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out uh all the parts that you do n't want to slop over onto you do n't have to be quite as precise about how you do it
use	use_vrb	because i think they that s an area that the other nations especially europe look down on us like oh we <unk> just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who have n't really attained it yet
use	use_vrb	and they use <unk> plates when they would n't need to use <unk> plates
use	use_vrb	and they use <unk> plates when they would n't need to use <unk> plates
use	use_vrb	i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh tuition if it s you know if i m short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can
use	use_vrb	um <unk> in the area that we <unk> in here there s a lot of places that use human factors people
use	use_vrb	have you did you use commercially available software
use	use_vrb	so we do n't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that
use	use_vrb	and uh you know they used to use it for leather i think
use	use_vrb	and uh even uh i did not uh use my math uh in my work
use	use_vrb	do you use a computer
use	use_vrb	i said because i want him to know how to use one of these
use	use_vrb	do you find you use it a lot
use	use_vrb	when this subject was mentioned to us i said well i went gee that s all i use mine for is a word <unk>
use	use_vrb	i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your your phone and and and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
use	use_vrb	so i imagine they use personal computers
use	use_vrb	in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming
use	use_vrb	um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
use	use_vrb	and so i do n't use drugs any more
use	use_vrb	i think that they do n't use <unk>
use	use_vrb	if i walk into a bad neighborhood i m sure i d want to walk through with you because i m sure you have good you know <unk> far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything
use	use_vrb	if i walk into a bad neighborhood i m sure i d want to walk through with you because i m sure you have good you know <unk> far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything
use	use_vrb	and you just never get to use it the way you d really like to
use	use_vrb	i think as uh as uh mother you know i use to think sometimes it s not so much uh it s not so much the kids
use	use_vrb	but i know they use that i mean they sell those
use	use_vrb	but i have an ex i had an exercise bike in the house but did n't seem to use it enough
use	use_vrb	but i only use a few of them
use	use_vrb	i think um the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year
use	use_vrb	and a uh we <unk> use a wood burning stove as well
use	use_vrb	boy he does n't go in and out of the tent a hundred times and use it as a play uh
use	use_vrb	well i <unk> seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the <unk> machine
use	use_vrb	and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an american express card and and pay it off every month
use	use_vrb	it also depends on who s cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that
use	use_vrb	or this person never use any drugs
use	use_vrb	it s a real easy to use color uh computer
use	use_vrb	i do n't use it as much as my children and my husband do
use	use_vrb	so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there
use	use_vrb	and if we ca n't take it and use it easily well how can you put that on like elderly people and you know just people that maybe just are n't blessed with as as much sharpness and <unk> mental acuity
use	use_vrb	we use word perfect lotus
use	use_vrb	and then i just use whatever colors i want to
use	use_vrb	well we could use some rain up here
use	use_vrb	i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
use	use_vrb	the packages i i do n't really use
use	use_vrb	of course there s you know third world countries that can use all kind of help
use	use_vrb	you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape
use	use_vrb	but i ca n't say i use them very often
use	use_vrb	and so we use those
use	use_vrb	but whether it s something that they can put to to economic use later on is a different subject
use	use_vrb	but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline
use	use_vrb	but uh still i think they ought to know how to use one and that it s not just a toy and that when it s not like on t v when someone gets shot uh they get back up
use	use_vrb	that that s that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn
use	use_vrb	what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal
use	use_vrb	do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
use	use_vrb	how do you use them
use	use_vrb	the circuses in europe used to use them um for the acts
use	use_vrb	i really did n't get to use them like oh there s mosquitoes
use	use_vrb	mostly just stuff that i can you know use right around the house or give away as gifts
use	use_vrb	uh i do n't even use a calculator for the stuff i m doing because it s all pretty round numbers
use	use_vrb	if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass
use	use_vrb	are n't do n't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their per for their pet theories or some such thing
use	use_vrb	no need to use this <unk> to play around with this space stuff anymore
use	use_vrb	they use joe blow s so uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone s credit
use	use_vrb	i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks
use	use_vrb	and uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh <unk> stuff
use	use_vrb	uh the ammunition is probably so old i m afraid to use it
use	use_vrb	or if they <unk> sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh impact machines or whatever you you can do that
use	use_vrb	or if they <unk> sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh impact machines or whatever you you can do that
use	use_vrb	oh is is that what you usually use in the house is latex
use	use_vrb	because we could sure use it
use	use_vrb	so if there s people out there that are willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them you know if they <unk> willing to do it
use	use_vrb	and usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um you know make a sauce with or something like that
use	use_vrb	i i use that for <unk> for rice
use	use_vrb	so that people would use this stuff <unk> over again
use	use_vrb	so you <unk> a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
use	use_vrb	and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something
use	use_vrb	but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also
use	use_vrb	uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they ca n't use
use	use_vrb	but uh i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
use	use_vrb	so we use that one
use	use_vrb	the way i d like to try and use it is um you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time
use	use_vrb	and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine uh trim work where i d use a small brush and uh try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
use	use_vrb	how how do you use it
use	use_vrb	i d do it i d use it for both
use	use_vrb	it s not a program to teach them to use the american money
use	use_vrb	we use a lot
use	use_vrb	and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing
use	use_vrb	and he showed me how to use his guns
use	use_vrb	but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
use	use_vrb	i mean there there s got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could you could use for <unk> <unk>
use	use_vrb	you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities
use	use_vrb	but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
use	use_vrb	but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
use	use_vrb	well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their visa or their <unk> for cash
use	use_vrb	what kind of driving just like commuting you d want to do it use it for
use	use_vrb	i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free
use	use_vrb	so you ca n't use it anyway
use	use_vrb	have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
use	use_vrb	do you use it
use	use_vrb	he needs his weekends free or to be able to use it or a day during the week or something
use	use_vrb	course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they do n't use
use	use_vrb	but i do n't use as many of those
use	use_vrb	i i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
use	use_vrb	that s what i m doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and use those hours to do
use	use_vrb	and what kinds of things do you use it for when you us when you go to their <unk> houses to them
use	use_vrb	and i use that sometimes too
use	use_vrb	well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas
use	use_vrb	but i did not know how to use those voting machines
use	use_vrb	but i want to show him how to use it so that he <unk> be able to vote
use	use_vrb	well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we ca n't synthesize it
use	use_vrb	and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything
use	use_vrb	but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge
use	use_vrb	well you know i use to feel like
use	use_vrb	so you ca n't use oil on wood
use	use_vrb	so i use it for that quite often
use	use_vrb	i probably would n't be able to use them
use	use_vrb	so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the japanese moving in and the russians moving in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate
use	use_vrb	you ca n't use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
use	use_vrb	the other thing about them is too if you really do n't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and have n't developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things
use	use_vrb	whenever the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines
use	use_vrb	i use to play soccer a lot in high school
use	use_vrb	i also use my p c to emulate a <unk> terminal for our i b m <unk> and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
use	use_vrb	so i do n't i do n't use i mean
use	use_vrb	other than you use them or you do n't use them you like them or you do n't like them
use	use_vrb	other than you use them or you do n't use them you like them or you do n't like them
use	use_vrb	oh well what kind of paint did you use for the um <unk>
use	use_vrb	and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband s family come
use	use_vrb	now i i do use gas cards
use	use_vrb	they do n't know that i do n't use drugs
use	use_vrb	well now they have those uh those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight
use	use_vrb	so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom
use	use_vrb	and uh i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me i find uh use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the n r a slogan arguments
use	use_vrb	well i know how to use one
use	use_vrb	and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago
use	use_vrb	but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again
use	use_vrb	she s not going to do it not going to use it
use	use_vrb	but uh my m mother and dad use to uh own a restaurant
use	use_vrb	so we um we use it s an i b m p s two also
use	use_vrb	i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then do n't use them
use	use_vrb	i just use the regular machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights
use	use_vrb	so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemical wise that they use to uh that they are testing with that they <unk> dumping
use	use_vrb	and we like here we use the p c s to do that
use	use_vrb	some of these muddy driveways could use it around here
use	use_vrb	and i know that they <unk> going to use you know the money for that to build some kind of <unk> field and that type of thing put lights and stuff
use	use_vrb	there was not there s not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day
use	use_vrb	because i did n't think i was really going to use it
use	use_vrb	but i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good
use	use_vrb	did you use a textured paint
use	use_vrb	i just really use it basically for transportation
use	use_vrb	and states c can use all the revenue they can get
use	use_vrb	but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
use	use_vrb	lilly lilly she said she said it s for your daughter to use
use	use_vrb	if he wants to use it he has to go get it
use	use_vrb	do you use them frequently
use	use_vrb	and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park
use	use_vrb	do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns
use	use_vrb	so as far as at home use uh we <unk> pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something
use	use_vrb	well when you use real people like that i think royalty especially you know
use	use_vrb	you probably use <unk> or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that you <unk> talking about
use	use_vrb	and i and i use it
use	use_vrb	i do n't use the free weights
use	use_vrb	i use tapes
use	use_vrb	well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight room or to uh to <unk> to go swimming
use	use_vrb	but uh they do still use plugs
use	use_vrb	i use a couple of things from <unk> that it says this is <unk> material
use	use_vrb	which one do you feel is better since you use them both
use	use_vrb	and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business
use	use_vrb	but i do n't use them very much though
use	use_vrb	and i use the <unk>
use	use_vrb	i do n't use a family budget
use	use_vrb	i use one all day at work
use	use_vrb	and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful because it keeps track of all your footnotes
use	use_vrb	so what do you use for <unk>
use	use_vrb	uh i use to also take an <unk> class about three days a week before work
use	use_vrb	they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it you know that was going to use it for good
use	use_vrb	so that s an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use
use	use_vrb	well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use
use	use_vrb	so the only thing that i use is soap
use	use_vrb	if someone was out to get you i think that a company or a boss could use this
use	use_vrb	and they um if they <unk> not going to use them they <unk> give them to somebody else
use	use_vrb	and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with
use	use_vrb	and so i it s a real difficult choice whether we want <unk> cups to fill up our <unk> or uh china cups to use up our water
use	use_vrb	or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she d use that
use	use_vrb	they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down
use	use_vrb	i always tell people that in the winter we use we used to uh
use	use_vrb	because they had n't originally gotten um permission from him to use it
use	use_vrb	and uh wait for an opportunity to use it
use	use_vrb	and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors
use	use_vrb	but i use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents
use	use_vrb	oh the chinese use slave labor too
use	use_vrb	uh what i <unk> gotten into more recently are the tools to use them
use	use_vrb	and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters
use	use_vrb	our mothers used to use it
use	use_vrb	the idea is to use their money
use	use_vrb	but uh you know you learn something every time you use it
use	use_vrb	so uh does your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook
use	use_vrb	can you use that one for personal use
use	use_vrb	so i use that
use	use_vrb	so all the persecution that they <unk> sort of use to it it s been sort of like you know
use	use_vrb	it seems like uh even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally
uses	uses_vrb	he always uses it to <unk> his lawn
uses	uses_vrb	one of our our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to uh generate electricity
uses	uses_vrb	and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done
uses	uses_vrb	is that what he uses
uses	uses_vrb	mostly my one sister uses hers for her children you know children s games
uses	uses_vrb	the uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with
uses	uses_vrb	i mean right now uh i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration
uses	uses_vrb	i think florida still uses electric chair
uses	uses_vrb	what kind of cloth uses that
uses	uses_vrb	she she uh she uses it now uh my sister to
uses	uses_vrb	and she uses it to compose and print out letters
uses	uses_vrb	it s all she <unk> uses it for
uses	uses_vrb	and he uses it for his school work
compact	compact_adj-nou	and it s just an old old compact that is super slow
compact	compact_adj-nou	we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time
compact	compact_adj-nou	uh they know have them on compact disc or or uh or <unk> or l p s
compact	compact_adj-nou	and so the best bet any <unk> these days are compact disk
content	content_nou	um where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ash content
content	content_nou	the in plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content that uh uh i went to use my dad in law s tiller
content	content_nou	it s hard to get a protein content up then
content	content_nou	well it uh depending on its moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
contest	contest_nou	it it s not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself
contest	contest_nou	they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything
contest	contest_nou	it it s good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest
contract	contract_nou	and it s just a matter of interpreting a contract
contract	contract_nou	apparently i think his contract is up after the end of this year
contract	contract_nou	and they do n't expand or or contract when the weather changes
contract	contract_nou	well did n't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers
contract	contract_nou	um if they did they d still have to pay his contract
contract	contract_nou	uh i m a contract programmer
contract	contract_nou	i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work
contract	contract_nou	well i m sure with the new uh <unk> contract awarding
contract	contract_nou	but i think they <unk> obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to g m after you know it s after they <unk> used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it
contrast	contrast_nou	and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the middle east war we just had where president bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening
conflict	conflict_nou	well back during the viet nam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war
conflict	conflict_nou	one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh peter arnett who had stayed in iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available
conflict	conflict_nou	it s like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
conflict	conflict_nou	and they say that uh that there was <unk> that there was like a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use
conflict	conflict_nou	and i think the issue should be settled before there s a conflict
conflict	conflict_nou	so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world
conflict	conflict_nou	you mean in the in the most recent conflict
conflict	conflict_nou	so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend
combine	combine_vrb	and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation
combine	combine_vrb	and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things
combine	combine_vrb	so i usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere
combine	combine_vrb	i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid
compress	compress	they do n't compress at all
construct	construct_vrb	and i think you know you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process
content	content_nou	so they <unk> pretty content now
content	content_nou	and it s like hey we <unk> content with this
content	content_nou	as a matter of fact i m very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything
contrast	contrast_vrb	well i mean how can you contrast the europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in latin america
convert	convert_vrb	we can convert
convert	convert_vrb	i guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers er just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and uh just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert
convert	convert_vrb	cause i still ca n't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters
convert	convert_vrb	and uh so i <unk> i <unk> lived with <unk> pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over
convert	convert_vrb	i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty six or fifty seven s a hundred uh <unk> a hundred kilometers
convert	convert_vrb	i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the problem because we <unk> so wound up in the in the system that we <unk> got that you know trying to convert over
convert	convert_vrb	and it <unk> convert every measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds
convert	convert_vrb	plus i would uh when they uh would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate
convert	convert_vrb	lot of people will buy in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the or do something
convert	convert_vrb	and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and you know and leaving it at that
convict	convict_vrb	i d rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody
convict	convict_vrb	the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there s enough
convict	convict_vrb	so you d you d rather see it harder to convict somebody
convict	convict_vrb	but you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you d ever know beyond a doubt
convict	convict_vrb	and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody
convict	convict_vrb	i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't uh convict someone who uh really should n't be convicted
convict	convict_vrb	on on on one hand you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it s <unk> they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy
convict	convict_vrb	i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you would n't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
convict	convict_vrb	i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah i guess i could convict him
convict	convict_vrb	so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
close	close_adj-nou	it looks like it s come close to that as it is
close	close_adj-nou	i do n't know that it s ever been seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that
close	close_adj-nou	well since you live close i do n't know if you know um about what louisville is doing with <unk>
close	close_adj-nou	well now can i improvise with adding and using another color instead you know what comes close because a lot of them are similar
close	close_adj-nou	i mean obviously if someone of mine who has close died i d probably feel differently
close	close_adj-nou	you just put them together as close as you can
close	close_adj-nou	even if i m uh doing something like an afghan if i m close to the end sometimes i <unk> do the same thing
close	close_adj-nou	now maybe you know that s pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new
close	close_adj-nou	and i and i i kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know
close	close_adj-nou	and so we would drive up to see that when <unk> whenever it was reasonably close
close	close_adj-nou	i i m in washington d c or at least very close to it
close	close_adj-nou	it s close to my uh oldest daughter s school
close	close_adj-nou	and because my brother is there uh he would have family close by
close	close_adj-nou	and i think maybe he would if it came real close
close	close_adj-nou	and it s you know i mean it s not even close to even being trained on a leash
close	close_adj-nou	you do not really feel that that really close to them
close	close_adj-nou	i live here because it s close to the university
close	close_adj-nou	but it s close to philadelphia and baltimore
close	close_adj-nou	and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
close	close_adj-nou	so it s getting close
close	close_adj-nou	and uh it s just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh
close	close_adj-nou	i mean i <unk> never seen two cats so close
close	close_adj-nou	well now we <unk> pretty close to the golden triangle are n't you
close	close_adj-nou	i live uh very near uh very close to the <unk> golf course
close	close_adj-nou	they both live close to
close	close_adj-nou	um especially there was a little store close by
close	close_adj-nou	it was real close to where i worked
close	close_adj-nou	but uh i guess it s close enough
close	close_adj-nou	<unk> why do you think that it s less close than it used to be
close	close_adj-nou	well but the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters
close	close_adj-nou	well but the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters
close	close_adj-nou	and be so close
close	close_adj-nou	san jose actually but but close
close	close_adj-nou	the child is going why do n't you want to be close to me and your other family
close	close_adj-nou	so any any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or or something like that
close	close_adj-nou	so they were all real close
close	close_adj-nou	and we are so close to shopping
close	close_adj-nou	well we live uh pretty close to the mesquite golf course
close	close_adj-nou	the house that house that i bought is close to a <unk> golf course
close	close_adj-nou	latin you know is very very very close to spanish
close	close_adj-nou	but that s uh the they <unk> so close
close	close_adj-nou	and and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the taurus is one of the highest u s cars
close	close_adj-nou	real close
close	close_adj-nou	i think it s somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference
close	close_adj-nou	so it s it s so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit
close	close_adj-nou	from what i understanding here at t i they run close to a thousand dollars an employee
close	close_adj-nou	well that s close to here
close	close_adj-nou	there s one close to where my mother is
close	close_adj-nou	we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone
close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> pretty close
close	close_adj-nou	but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them
close	close_adj-nou	i m not sure that i m not up fairly close to that
close	close_adj-nou	we loved the we loved the the new jersey area too because the the lakes were really pretty close you know
close	close_adj-nou	about maybe oh close to a year ago now i guess i i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
close	close_adj-nou	and i you know i do n't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together
close	close_adj-nou	and that really made it a very interesting uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they <unk> going to be real close or whether they <unk> just going to be partners you know
close	close_adj-nou	how close is it to a home environment
close	close_adj-nou	but i i would imagine that because of the how close the the vote was i m uh i mean almost certainly would have to be
close	close_adj-nou	uh pretty close to it
close	close_adj-nou	they finished pretty close to five hundred last year did n't they
close	close_adj-nou	and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning
close	close_adj-nou	are you close to <unk>
close	close_adj-nou	that is one thing that i do n't enjoy about it is the houses are too close together
close	close_adj-nou	uh and i really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close
close	close_adj-nou	i said i was n't close to downtown pontiac
close	close_adj-nou	uh just close to methodist hospital
close	close_adj-nou	they live close then
close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> also see that there s there s a different way of life and those families are really close
close	close_adj-nou	though uh washington i think is uh close by
close	close_adj-nou	it when i came on it was great because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered
close	close_adj-nou	with all of you living so close together
close	close_adj-nou	so it s close to getting uh one t v per person they say
close	close_adj-nou	but uh you know since i live here so close to arlington uh that s the team that i <unk> been kind of following
close	close_adj-nou	nor do we live that close to a lake anymore
close	close_adj-nou	<unk> is pretty close to new orleans
close	close_adj-nou	pretty close
close	close_adj-nou	that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper
close	close_adj-nou	but i guess <unk> s would come as close as anything
close	close_adj-nou	well well we live we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley
close	close_adj-nou	real close
close	close_adj-nou	how do you feel about them i mean since you <unk> kind of been close to that
close	close_adj-nou	they tried to keep it you know as very close to real
close	close_adj-nou	i do n't know how close i <unk> follow them though
close	close_adj-nou	that the people that worked there were very were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible
close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> almost as close
close	close_adj-nou	they can not close off the mexican border not because it s physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country
close	close_adj-nou	and they <unk> get close to it
close	close_adj-nou	see and here in lubbock everything s so close
close	close_adj-nou	your family does n't live close then
close	close_adj-nou	because s san antonio is n't that close to you are they
close	close_adj-nou	are you close to getting it done
close	close_adj-nou	i think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even
close	close_adj-nou	usually involving the prime minister or people very close to him
close	close_adj-nou	and so uh it s not quite as close as it used to be
close	close_adj-nou	do n't you want to be close to me i mean you know be with other people
close	close_adj-nou	you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it s there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
close	close_adj-nou	uh we went camping at uh lake bonham which is is pretty close here um
close	close_adj-nou	it s probably pretty close to what i have because i have the same kind of thing at work
close	close_adj-nou	there s a big difference between baltimore and washington even though they <unk> so close
close	close_adj-nou	my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family
close	close_vrb	but but supposedly once you have an office in d c or you know and and staff it with people it s really tough to close it down
close	close_vrb	in texas i m serious if it gets cold and it looks like it s going to rain i i swear they close everything down
close	close_vrb	like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did
close	close_vrb	but to me texas see and kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school
close	close_vrb	i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen
close	close_vrb	and uh i just close it out i guess
close	close_vrb	well if they close it in see we <unk> have the best of both worlds then as they <unk> talking about doing
live	live_adj	and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
live	live_adj	well i <unk> gone to you know one for real live trek convention
live	live_adj	i think they all that thought well we have a live one
live	live_adj	but they had live crawfish on sale
live	live_adj	there once a year live
live	live_adj	and one of them broadcast every twins game live you know
live	live_adj	in fact the buffalo the scene the big buffalo herd scene that was that was a live scene
live	live_adj	uh and i guess that s good when it s live if you if you <unk> really want that
lives	lives_nou	day cares have have have popped up and become a lot more um a lot bigger part of of the kids lives
lives	lives_nou	momentum is uh driving force in our lives
lives	lives_nou	and um i i like to uh read about people who have been a successful you know who who made a success of their lives
lives	lives_nou	in other words they just <unk> their lives differently
lives	lives_nou	because you <unk> endangering everybody s lives if you if it s something like that
lives	lives_nou	they risk their lives every day
lives	lives_nou	even though the person is involved in so many other people s lives you still see a a real person in those situations
lives	lives_nou	and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed
lives	lives_nou	i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it
lives	lives_nou	family and friends are usually well family s tied up with their own lives and things and usually working
lives	lives_nou	we get so involved in our work lives and just social lives and so forth
lives	lives_nou	we get so involved in our work lives and just social lives and so forth
lives	lives_nou	uh you know it it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the state when they so callously and usually so you know without even thinking or without any concern uh you know end somebody else s life and in a lot of cases several people s lives
lives	lives_nou	and and children s lives were simpler because mother was there
lives	lives_nou	but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically
lives	lives_nou	as the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from from people who have been independent all their lives
lives	lives_nou	but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives
lives	lives_nou	but as far as uh you know the peace corps i guess i suppose there s a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
lives	lives_nou	much as other cultures disagree our lives do n't revolve around our children
lives	lives_nou	and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war
lives	lives_nou	because i look at airline pilots bus drivers you know people that really have other peoples lives in their hands truck drivers
lives	lives_nou	but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse uh i do n't think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
lives	lives_nou	we lost lives
lives	lives_nou	um do you think i mean do you think our <unk> the investment in lives and money was worth it
lives	lives_nou	i refused to cram their lives full
lives	lives_nou	but then again also you ca n't bring back lives that have been taken anyway
lives	lives_nou	for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there s where there s uh endangerment to their own life and other people s lives
lives	lives_nou	um looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now i i m not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives
lives	lives_nou	but really if if they were going to save people s lives
lives	lives_nou	this is a uh a couple uh emigrated from china early in in their lives
lives	lives_nou	so i feel like you know that s is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives
lives	lives_nou	but i do n't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
lives	lives_nou	i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
lives	lives_nou	even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk
lead	lead_nou	and uh the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
learned	learned_vrb	well i learned something already
learned	learned_vrb	and uh i learned to
learned	learned_vrb	i feel like i <unk> learned a lot about the piano
learned	learned_vrb	that s what i learned a lot of languages on was an apple two e in my high school
learned	learned_vrb	so you worked you learned how to solve your problems on your own
learned	learned_vrb	so i learned a lot about them
learned	learned_vrb	but well i just i i m glad we <unk> learned
learned	learned_vrb	they never learned to be responsible when
learned	learned_vrb	or maybe more than that as i <unk> learned
learned	learned_vrb	they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they did n't learn
learned	learned_vrb	i uh i went to purdue university for a couple of years and uh really learned to hate indianapolis while i was out there
learned	learned_vrb	to if you if you go on the attack i and put some sensational thing before the public as mike <unk> learned in the last campaign and it is not refuted people will you know uh believe it
learned	learned_vrb	and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to
learned	learned_vrb	uh she learned to drive i think when i was um a teenager
learned	learned_vrb	but uh i do think we learned
learned	learned_vrb	and of course we learned too
learned	learned_vrb	uh i think we learned too much of the effects
learned	learned_vrb	i <unk> learned a lot about playing the piano
learned	learned_vrb	but you know i never really learned to operate one
learned	learned_vrb	but now i <unk> i <unk> learned how to sew
learned	learned_vrb	i learned i i learned <unk> uh
learned	learned_vrb	i learned i i learned <unk> uh
learned	learned_vrb	you <unk> going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home
learned	learned_vrb	and and that s really what we <unk> learned about it
learned	learned_vrb	what we learned
learned	learned_vrb	even when i was in elementary school years ago they were you know we learned what a centimeter was and a <unk> and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements things like that
learned	learned_vrb	i mean i think my children learned the metric system
learned	learned_vrb	i learned something here
learned	learned_vrb	so i i i do think that we <unk> learned from it
learned	learned_vrb	and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know
learned	learned_vrb	so <unk> i feel that i learned a great deal from my students uh with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents
learned	learned_vrb	and so i learned that on there too
learned	learned_vrb	that s one thing that i have learned in <unk> working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you do n't really know what they <unk> like
learned	learned_vrb	and i learned <unk> on that
learned	learned_vrb	so once i got into this uh <unk> i learned all the physiological <unk> <unk> advantages to it
learned	learned_vrb	and i i think that we learned from that
learned	learned_vrb	uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman
learned	learned_vrb	i have n't learned to hit the ball easy
learned	learned_vrb	but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older
learned	learned_vrb	so my mother learned from that
learned	learned_vrb	so uh i learned to repair one
learned	learned_vrb	and i learned all the health benefits of you know
lead	lead_nou-vrb	they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead
lead	lead_nou-vrb	i think that uh my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that s a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn
lead	lead_nou-vrb	it s a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that lead to the events that brought about the civil war
lead	lead_nou-vrb	i guess right now what they <unk> what they <unk> primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess united states and and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production
lead	lead_nou-vrb	you know it s too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the rangers you know
lead	lead_nou-vrb	why i i m i m a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and and easy i do n't know i should n't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh <unk> uh uh over the uh <unk> uh might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe
lead	lead_nou-vrb	well and sometimes that s this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
lead	lead_nou-vrb	but uh a and occasionally i i pick up like time magazine or something i think uh if they <unk> got an interesting lead story
live	live_vrb	and they live at home you know
live	live_vrb	and uh they live in peoria illinois
live	live_vrb	well i live on a i live on a lake here
live	live_vrb	well i live on a i live on a lake here
live	live_vrb	and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
live	live_vrb	and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
live	live_vrb	but it s that not getting involved that impersonal society i think we live in today
live	live_vrb	well uh i do n't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto
live	live_vrb	i live in northwest garland
live	live_vrb	and it it s just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style
live	live_vrb	i live in dallas
live	live_vrb	and i d a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there
live	live_vrb	well since you live close i do n't know if you know um about what louisville is doing with <unk>
live	live_vrb	and my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here
live	live_vrb	so where do you live at
live	live_vrb	and and you know uh especially now i live in in massachusetts you know
live	live_vrb	it s it s really frightening that we <unk> not we <unk> trying to live in our own little cocoons
live	live_vrb	what what state do you live in
live	live_vrb	we live out by dulles airport
live	live_vrb	it depends on the state you live actually
live	live_vrb	um where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ash content
live	live_vrb	uh we have friends in germany and uh have family that live near the black forest area
live	live_vrb	uh i live in dallas
live	live_vrb	well actually i live in florida
live	live_vrb	do you know my grandparents live in durant
live	live_vrb	i live uh over in the lake highlands area if you <unk> familiar with that
live	live_vrb	but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some you know
live	live_vrb	and your wife s folks still live in colorado
live	live_vrb	i have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town
live	live_vrb	well out here we um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a natural you know natural grasslands
live	live_vrb	uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay
live	live_vrb	we um live in a district that has open classrooms
live	live_vrb	there was a court case uh here where i live just a few months ago
live	live_vrb	pick out where you want to live
live	live_vrb	i would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in
live	live_vrb	so you said that you live in <unk>
live	live_vrb	and we <unk> going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month
live	live_vrb	and uh i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home
live	live_vrb	we have one earth to live on
live	live_vrb	i live out in the country
live	live_vrb	well uh i live in garland
live	live_vrb	we have a neighborhood watch program in the house uh the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce uh home theft burglary and things of that sort
live	live_vrb	i mean there if you do n't live in a house that s at least seventy five to hundred years old you know you <unk> just nobody practically
live	live_vrb	and my mom my mom s or my family uh we all live in southern california
live	live_vrb	i live in a real small little place
live	live_vrb	we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life
live	live_vrb	well what i did was i went to a <unk> class in a new location in richardson near where we live in north dallas
live	live_vrb	we use it live in california
live	live_vrb	well i live in minneapolis
live	live_vrb	what area do you live in
live	live_vrb	i do not live in a city
live	live_vrb	what part of the state do you live in
live	live_vrb	and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up
live	live_vrb	oh gosh i think i would hate to live in california
live	live_vrb	uh i i would cheerfully live there
live	live_vrb	i live <unk> on the border
live	live_vrb	just have to live with it i guess
live	live_vrb	and see i live in an apartment
live	live_vrb	uh i live on the outskirts of baltimore
live	live_vrb	but uh i live in orlando florida usually
live	live_vrb	i live in dallas
live	live_vrb	you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you where you live
live	live_vrb	they do n't understand it as we do n't understand the way they live
live	live_vrb	and so i i m i could n't live my life without a p c
live	live_vrb	we used to live in utah
live	live_vrb	they had chosen santa barbara california for this summer and and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the texas oklahoma area
live	live_vrb	i live in garland
live	live_vrb	and uh you do n't have any any kind of a good environment to live in you know
live	live_vrb	so i would uh not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in uh because they <unk> <unk> uh
live	live_vrb	do you live in plano
live	live_vrb	and you probably if it were you you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
live	live_vrb	and uh it s interesting because the county i live in
live	live_vrb	where d you live
live	live_vrb	i live alone in an apartment and uh except for the cat
live	live_vrb	i live in a rural area
live	live_vrb	but that is an excuse and that would i could live with
live	live_vrb	i live here because it s close to the university
live	live_vrb	we live in plano
live	live_vrb	because <unk> i live in a college town in penn state university
live	live_vrb	i live in richardson
live	live_vrb	but i used to i used to live in india
live	live_vrb	well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that
live	live_vrb	well see i live in virginia
live	live_vrb	and uh i have some friends that live down there
live	live_vrb	i <unk> i would hate to think that anybody thought uh the lot we live on as a ranch
live	live_vrb	uh do you live in a home
live	live_vrb	oh well i could n't live without the family vacations
live	live_vrb	only the niners because i used to live out in california
live	live_vrb	well you live almost in oklahoma
live	live_vrb	do you ever think that there s a crime that s just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just does n't deserve to live anymore
live	live_vrb	they live in <unk>
live	live_vrb	but realistically that s i m i m realizing that s probably not going to be possible um for middle class people to be able to live just on one income
live	live_vrb	and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him
live	live_vrb	where do you live
live	live_vrb	i live uh very near uh very close to the <unk> golf course
live	live_vrb	well i i just live in a i live in an apartment now
live	live_vrb	well i i just live in a i live in an apartment now
live	live_vrb	they both live close to
live	live_vrb	you must live in an older home too then
live	live_vrb	my uh my folks used to live there
live	live_vrb	i did n't live in the city of pontiac
live	live_vrb	but i live in a a metropolitan area
live	live_vrb	i live in the dallas area
live	live_vrb	and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main street
live	live_vrb	i i live in uh vermont
live	live_vrb	uh but it has been um it s been interesting and particularly i i think because the society in which we live families are separated
live	live_vrb	i live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime
live	live_vrb	oh you <unk> just live down there
live	live_vrb	well i live in san antonio
live	live_vrb	and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh
live	live_vrb	we live right in the corner
live	live_vrb	i used to live in dallas in arlington actually
live	live_vrb	i live right on a main thoroughfare
live	live_vrb	i live in plano actually
live	live_vrb	but i live in pensacola florida
live	live_vrb	uh i had had an a f s student from germany live with us our senior year
live	live_vrb	and they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something
live	live_vrb	she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town
live	live_vrb	but if you do n't live near there that s not worth
live	live_vrb	so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary
live	live_vrb	what kind of house do you live in
live	live_vrb	and they live just about three miles away
live	live_vrb	i live in a development
live	live_vrb	and then we still live with air pollution
live	live_vrb	i live in town
live	live_vrb	and they just live
live	live_vrb	i do kind of live in the downtown area
live	live_vrb	uh i do n't live in a house
live	live_vrb	and i live in raleigh north carolina
live	live_vrb	and i live in plano texas
live	live_vrb	we live in the saginaw area
live	live_vrb	see we live up in tax free new hampshire and drive down to massachusetts to work
live	live_vrb	they live in a small town called david which is northern panama up near costa rica
live	live_vrb	well we live uh pretty close to the mesquite golf course
live	live_vrb	uh i i live alone now
live	live_vrb	they live in alabama
live	live_vrb	i live in texas
live	live_vrb	so you live in garland then
live	live_vrb	i m glad i do n't live in a big city just because i mean not just because i would n't feel safe
live	live_vrb	there s there s a daily news uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they <unk> they <unk> expanding i guess
live	live_vrb	except we live in plano texas now
live	live_vrb	now i i live alone
live	live_vrb	if you live around the dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because they <unk> really into it
live	live_vrb	so if my parents do need to live with someone it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for you know
live	live_vrb	uh well i do n't actually live in the city
live	live_vrb	and um and they live in an apartment complex
live	live_vrb	um it s <unk> it actually funny that um i live just outside of baltimore
live	live_vrb	do you live in the dallas area
live	live_vrb	where do you live
live	live_vrb	i have a sister who used to live in kennesaw georgia
live	live_vrb	and my parents live down there
live	live_vrb	and uh we went with our daughter and son in law to visit his parents who live there
live	live_vrb	we live next to a set of railroad tracks
live	live_vrb	to come in and live with them
live	live_vrb	i do n't have to live through many any of those really
live	live_vrb	i live in an apartment
live	live_vrb	i mean when you live in areas like that where there s so much they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is
live	live_vrb	well we live in roy
live	live_vrb	well now do you live in a a home or zero lot home
live	live_vrb	we live out in the country
live	live_vrb	we live in an apartment
live	live_vrb	i live near a <unk>
live	live_vrb	i live in a rural area
live	live_vrb	i <unk> i live right across the street from a a big lake here um
live	live_vrb	and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it s stolen before i can get out and get it
live	live_vrb	they live in <unk>
live	live_vrb	i live in houston
live	live_vrb	well i know that we have some relatives that live around like the <unk> area in there
live	live_vrb	i live in richardson
live	live_vrb	i live up in the uh northeast corner
live	live_vrb	the house that i used to live in had one bath and a half
live	live_vrb	that s kind of ironic because i do n't live too far from oklahoma either
live	live_vrb	and if that s gone um i i really do n't know how to live very well
live	live_vrb	<unk> did you actually live in saint louis
live	live_vrb	as a matter of fact i just paid my richardson taxes because i live in richardson and supplemented the robin hoods very thoroughly i think
live	live_vrb	but i do live in the better well in the best part of the city though
live	live_vrb	and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
live	live_vrb	it s it s so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective
live	live_vrb	you do n't have to live on the you know for a street life
live	live_vrb	well i i actually live in new hampshire
live	live_vrb	i take it you live in the dallas area
live	live_vrb	is <unk> a nice area to live
live	live_vrb	but if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards
live	live_vrb	for example there is a uh <unk> complex next to the apartment complex where i live
live	live_vrb	where do you live
live	live_vrb	i used to my wife and i we used to live in san antonio couple years ago
live	live_vrb	but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse uh i do n't think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
live	live_vrb	and i i live in a town home here in raleigh
live	live_vrb	where do you live now
live	live_vrb	there is n't any one place where most of us live
live	live_vrb	i live on a third floor now
live	live_vrb	where where do you live
live	live_vrb	i live in a motor home
live	live_vrb	really is n't that much for elderly people to live on
live	live_vrb	you just live there now
live	live_vrb	i live i live in plano
live	live_vrb	i live i live in plano
live	live_vrb	uh idaho is where i live
live	live_vrb	uh where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
live	live_vrb	are you <unk> do you live at home with your parents
live	live_vrb	i live in vermont
live	live_vrb	um the the team i live and die with actually is the red sox
live	live_vrb	i i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary
live	live_vrb	to come in and live with them
live	live_vrb	and i uh i i have not found one yet that i would rather live in
live	live_vrb	i live in one
live	live_vrb	what part of what part of the country do you live in
live	live_vrb	i mean uh you know you ca n't live in dallas without you know
live	live_vrb	where uh where abouts do you live
live	live_vrb	not up um where i live
live	live_vrb	and i used to live in colorado oh sometime ago for a couple of years
live	live_vrb	we live near washington
live	live_vrb	they live close then
live	live_vrb	i live on one of <unk> that little ten mile spot
live	live_vrb	i live in a big <unk>
live	live_vrb	i live in rhode island
live	live_vrb	my grandparents live there
live	live_vrb	i live in plano in a four bedroom two bath house which is
live	live_vrb	i live in san antonio
live	live_vrb	i live in a in a town house which is you know
live	live_vrb	and it s like you know um they live back in <unk> where we came from two hundred years ago
live	live_vrb	i used to live in indianapolis
live	live_vrb	we live out here by
live	live_vrb	where d you live at
live	live_vrb	and uh we live right outside the city
live	live_vrb	she did n't live with us
live	live_vrb	we live in a kind of small town
live	live_vrb	uh we live in plano
live	live_vrb	i live over near white rock lake
live	live_vrb	you know i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an apartment
live	live_vrb	i have uh in laws that live in saudi arabia that stayed there during all of it too
live	live_vrb	and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room
live	live_vrb	the neighborhood that we live they are switching to an alternate calendar this year
live	live_vrb	so it s it s one that you can live through
live	live_vrb	i live right by dallas
live	live_vrb	but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood
live	live_vrb	well we we live in a brick story and a half uh
live	live_vrb	my parents live in boston
live	live_vrb	where do you live
live	live_vrb	where do where do you live
live	live_vrb	especially if you live on campus and you do n't have a car you just go crazy
live	live_vrb	but uh you know since i live here so close to arlington uh that s the team that i <unk> been kind of following
live	live_vrb	nor do we live that close to a lake anymore
live	live_vrb	and uh we live in kind of a small town
live	live_vrb	well uh we live in a a brick home in far north dallas
live	live_vrb	where do you live
live	live_vrb	i live in maryland
live	live_vrb	i live in you know the real <unk> part i guess
live	live_vrb	and we live on one of those blocks that it s a neighborhood watch block
live	live_vrb	because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the <unk> that surrounds washington
live	live_vrb	and as far as where i live i do n't have to do that
live	live_vrb	and i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids you know
live	live_vrb	we live in an apartment also
live	live_vrb	my wife and i we live in dallas too
live	live_vrb	where do you live
live	live_vrb	uh i used to live in the plano school district
live	live_vrb	but they do n't live at home
live	live_vrb	you live in virginia now
live	live_vrb	but i i actually live in florida
live	live_vrb	well do they all live in the area
live	live_vrb	where do you all live
live	live_vrb	there are certainly parts of town i would not want to live in
live	live_vrb	now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it
live	live_vrb	do you have that where you live
live	live_vrb	i live in atlanta also
live	live_vrb	i live i live on the second story apartments
live	live_vrb	i live i live on the second story apartments
live	live_vrb	but you know i i can live
live	live_vrb	oh you must live in this area
live	live_vrb	but really i m i happy i i well i m curious how other people live
live	live_vrb	uh i live in texas now
live	live_vrb	it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly
live	live_vrb	and now that i live in florida
live	live_vrb	it s funny uh depending on where you live
live	live_vrb	but does your sister live in a big community
live	live_vrb	because i live just south of the interstate
live	live_vrb	well well we live we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley
live	live_vrb	well well we live we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley
live	live_vrb	in a big city like that most houses i would think would be sort of like what we live in just a you know basic tract house
live	live_vrb	where you live it gets very hot
live	live_vrb	what area of the country do you live in
live	live_vrb	but uh the problem is that so i m paying state tax even if i do n't live here
live	live_vrb	i live in a suburb of dallas
live	live_vrb	oh that s where i live
live	live_vrb	and uh i live in garland
live	live_vrb	<unk> i know that there s certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a <unk> <unk> <unk> catholic type area
live	live_vrb	the area i live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned
live	live_vrb	and uh she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary
live	live_vrb	i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so
live	live_vrb	well the thing is is that i live in a dorm
live	live_vrb	my in laws live on a lake uh a little bit east of dallas kind of in the piney woods
live	live_vrb	i live in a i live in a very nice suburb
live	live_vrb	i live in a i live in a very nice suburb
live	live_vrb	so we <unk> been here a little over six years now and uh have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in
live	live_vrb	so uh you live in dallas
live	live_vrb	so that s a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up
live	live_vrb	uh if you you know have family that uh you can live with
live	live_vrb	i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work
live	live_vrb	so you usually are living where your parents live
live	live_vrb	i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood
live	live_vrb	we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
live	live_vrb	oh me too because i do n't even know if i could live through it now
live	live_vrb	uh but i do have friends that live in the city
live	live_vrb	but people that live for it and you know eat a bunch of different pills and all that kind of stuff it gets a little bit obsessive
live	live_vrb	is uh because you live in austin is she thinking about the university of texas
live	live_vrb	we uh we used to live in an apartment
live	live_vrb	so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will uh say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
live	live_vrb	you know you can come to south tyler where i live
live	live_vrb	i have a brother in minnesota that used to live in wisconsin
live	live_vrb	do you live in dallas
live	live_vrb	your family does n't live close then
live	live_vrb	um i think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live
live	live_vrb	and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake
live	live_vrb	i where i live is a house that s seventeen years old when i bought it
live	live_vrb	jay where do you live in texas
live	live_vrb	i live right near white rock lake
live	live_vrb	and a good bit of that was filmed right in cincinnati which is just forty five miles from from where i am where i actually live in a suburb of dayton
live	live_vrb	um uh do you live right in the city itself
live	live_vrb	do you live in a real small town or or out in the country
live	live_vrb	i live in an apartment
live	live_vrb	i have a sister that used to live in <unk>
live	live_vrb	oh it s a wonderful place to live
live	live_vrb	you know i used to live up north
live	live_vrb	uh county i live in in the past ten years only had t two capital murders
live	live_vrb	we used to live up in seattle for a couple of years
live	live_vrb	do you live in the high <unk>
live	live_vrb	you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it s there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
live	live_vrb	and i live in <unk> texas too
live	live_vrb	well hopefully this one here cocoa will live a full life
live	live_vrb	because i used to live in uh massachusetts
live	live_vrb	i live in a pretty small apartment
live	live_vrb	oh that s where i live too
live	live_vrb	but i live in raleigh north carolina right now
live	live_vrb	they now see what i look like what i live like
live	live_vrb	and it s almost inconceivable now because the <unk> machines and and everything have become such you know <unk> such a a <unk> a part of the way we live
live	live_vrb	because i i just live to read
live	live_vrb	they live down in college station where his parents do too
lives	lives_vrb	we have family that lives outside of the state
lives	lives_vrb	i had a friend from college that lives in uh
lives	lives_vrb	you ca n't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they <unk> got to be careful
lives	lives_vrb	and then my mother who s very elderly lives with us
lives	lives_vrb	and and <unk> the relationship between the family is is really now now the mother in law lives in the house with them
lives	lives_vrb	but i have a boyfriend that lives in fresno
lives	lives_vrb	my sister lives in turkey
lives	lives_vrb	i mean i m sure i m going to be seeing it because in a week to amarillo where my sister lives
lives	lives_vrb	a person lives across the street from me uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep
lives	lives_vrb	my brother lives where i work
lives	lives_vrb	so everything that lives around here is real tough
lives	lives_vrb	m m m my sister who also lives here in dallas uh tends to uh chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty
lives	lives_vrb	uh my dad lives in the state capital which is pierre
lives	lives_vrb	my uh my sister lives in charlotte
lives	lives_vrb	you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives
lives	lives_vrb	he he lives in andover
lives	lives_vrb	she lives
lives	lives_vrb	she is her uh her family you know lives there
lives	lives_vrb	well my brother lives ten miles from here
lives	lives_vrb	she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town
lives	lives_vrb	and uh seems like everyone that lives around us ends up you know hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone
lives	lives_vrb	i know somebody who lives back there
lives	lives_vrb	i <unk> got a friend that uh lives right next to the cowboys training camp
lives	lives_vrb	she um um my sister in law now lives in um switzerland
lives	lives_vrb	in fact i <unk> got family that still lives up there
lives	lives_vrb	she has a sister that lives in uh phoenix that has one and uh really uh enjoys it
lives	lives_vrb	well all see all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about
lives	lives_vrb	and i have a daughter that lives down in north carolina
lives	lives_vrb	my sister one of my sisters lives in plano
lives	lives_vrb	i have a brother in law that lives in minnesota
lives	lives_vrb	a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house
lives	lives_vrb	and then i have a sister that lives in austin
lives	lives_vrb	i my little brother lives in austin right now
lives	lives_vrb	and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away
lives	lives_vrb	uh my uh sister lives on lake norman just
lives	lives_vrb	uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over
lives	lives_vrb	her grandmother lives there
lives	lives_vrb	and then my family lives in philadelphia now
lives	lives_vrb	and uh she lives in pennsylvania
lives	lives_vrb	a lot of the older family lives in vernon
lives	lives_vrb	he lives in cleveland
lives	lives_vrb	one of our our kids lives out on the east coast
lives	lives_vrb	i have a brother that lives in uh uh south bend indiana
lives	lives_vrb	but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something
lives	lives_vrb	my daughter my daughter lives down in <unk>
lives	lives_vrb	he lives in a little farmhouse on a farm
lives	lives_vrb	and uh my sister in law lives in chicago
lives	lives_vrb	uh he lives <unk>
lives	lives_vrb	i know they <unk> started over in richardson where my dad lives
lives	lives_vrb	oh and i know somebody that lives there
lives	lives_vrb	our family ranges from oh goodness well australia i have a brother lives in australia to uh boise idaho and and uh all kinds of places
mouth	mouth_nou	of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he he just lines up people against him
mouth	mouth_nou	and it has a huge strong mouth
mouth	mouth_nou	and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth
mouth	mouth_nou	and it had the rock in its mouth not the chicken
mouth	mouth_nou	uh we have a lot of cotton mouth
mouth	mouth_nou	and um just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff
mouth	mouth_nou	and he walked around the house with his <unk> face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he would n't let anybody pull it
mouth	mouth_nou	and friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
mouth	mouth_nou	so you know even even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh jesus said the money in the fish s mouth or in the fisher inside the fish
mouth	mouth_nou	and he always had this uh this wonderful quality of c being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
moderate	moderate_adj-nou	but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it s like i ca n't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars um you know three times a week
minute	minute	because you <unk> expected to work on stuff up until the last minute
minute	minute	but the minute marks are done
minute	minute	they always say you <unk> talked your ten minute limit
minute	minute	it s like wait a minute you know
minute	minute	wait a minute
minute	minute	and i think that s what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute
minute	minute	can i run a minute and shut my radio off
minute	minute	so it is a forty five minute drive to the mountains
minute	minute	they <unk> are going to interrupt us any minute now
minute	minute	so you <unk> all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute
minute	minute	but we can do our part take an extra minute or two
minute	minute	wait a minute
minute	minute	but at to me it s every minute s agony
minute	minute	but they they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories
minute	minute	i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds
minute	minute	hang on a minute
minute	minute	it s not so much that they come to you every minute
minute	minute	so like that took like a minute
minute	minute	i guess the minute marks
minute	minute	the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know
minute	minute	i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
minute	minute	like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you <unk> getting raises every eighteen months you got to go now hey wait a minute
minute	minute	uh i have n't had a minute s trouble with it
minute	minute	that s like world war three every minute
minute	minute	i was going oh wait a minute
minute	minute	was was the whole face done or just the numbers and and like minute marks
minute	minute	it s kind of a strange thing we <unk> been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute
minute	minute	just a minute
minute	minute	i if i have a minute that s what i i do
minute	minute	and i would n't trade change a minute of it for anything
minute	minute	the minute they get married everything s supposed to be cut and dried
minute	minute	and i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what s happening
minute	minute	and if you go just a little bit ways in i d say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas uh the weather completely changes
minute	minute	and so and i say well wait a minute
minute	minute	but uh it s about a thirty minute exercise every morning
minute	minute	wait a minute
minute	minute	and i did n't believe it for a minute
minute	minute	oh can you can you hold on for just a minute
minute	minute	the minute i said the word he he he s <unk> at the bit
minute	minute	it s a had not had one minute s problem with it
minute	minute	but it s it s always been a formula uh for t v that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up you know dying
minute	minute	and now it s the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine
minute	minute	but the minute the sun went down um that s when it s usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
minute	minute	but the minute the sun went down um that s when it s usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
minute	minute	now just to focus on that a minute i guess uh uh
minute	minute	so they just want black and white which <unk> see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
mobile	mobile_nou-art	and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
mobile	mobile	and if they <unk> out there buying that many cars then there s that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working
mobile	mobile	i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe you know like a a small camper
mobile	mobile	and we <unk> the mobile mobile society uh
mobile	mobile	and we <unk> the mobile mobile society uh
mobile	mobile	we at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
permit	permit_vrb	um i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern europe for example uh particularly the uh the jewish uh uh people from russia
permit	permit_vrb	i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last uh several years
permit	permit_vrb	well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country uh i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um some quotas
perfect	perfect_adj	well i guess like with uh israel is a perfect example
perfect	perfect_adj	it was just too perfect at all times
perfect	perfect_adj	uh not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago
perfect	perfect_adj	you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
perfect	perfect_adj	not everybody has a picture perfect body
perfect	perfect_adj	the lines in there were just perfect
perfect	perfect_adj	uh nothing is perfect
perfect	perfect_adj	so i guess if they perfect that <unk> is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
perfect	perfect_adj	you do the best you can to make it perfect you know
perfect	perfect_adj	i uh i found that uh it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
perfect	perfect_adj	we use word perfect lotus
perfect	perfect_adj	and uh i m holding out for city slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it s just perfect for our age group
perfect	perfect_adj	i mean the system is n't perfect
perfect	perfect_adj	oh that s a perfect age for <unk>
perfect	perfect_adj	so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes when you know these are perfect
perfect	perfect_adj	so that s perfect
perfect	perfect_adj	they do n't have that perfect look
perfect	perfect_adj	um as i was sitting there i thought the weather s been perfect
perfect	perfect_adj	those are perfect boxes to put files in
perfect	perfect_adj	if it s a perfect shot go for it
permit	permit_nou	you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that
permit	permit_nou	well up uh up in new england where i m from uh you had to get a permit before you could buy any <unk> am ammunition
permit	permit_nou	takes two weeks for that system to process uh your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition
project	project_nou	that s uh that s a kind of low risk sort of project is n't it i guess
project	project_nou	so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a a project
project	project_nou	uh and my family now knows if they come into my study and uh i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i m trying to get a project done uh at school uh and i m humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know to just stay away
project	project_nou	i started a project it s been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for christmas
project	project_nou	see we our choir is doing this as a money <unk> raising project
project	project_nou	that s how i got into uh into the switchboard project and all that
project	project_nou	see around around here it s like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors
project	project_nou	see around around here it s like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors
project	project_nou	um and it s uh i think it started out to be um just kind of a test a pilot project
project	project_nou	what was this project
project	project_nou	well i d say tackle one project first and see how it goes
project	project_nou	well we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project
project	project_nou	um a gal who works uh with t i on this project
project	project_nou	and then when i start a new project i go through and see if i if i you know
project	project_nou	this is this is kind of a fun project
project	project_nou	it s a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know
project	project_nou	my current project is a walkway which i m building around the house and out to the backyard to uh you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh <unk> on top of that
project	project_nou	but uh i have a friend who uh is working on this project
project	project_nou	as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom
project	project_nou	it was n't you know like a commercial project or something
project	project_nou	and uh have you talked with a lot of people in this project
project	project_nou	they could send all the people over to uh you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported
project	project_nou	well my best friend in virginia s daughter is a part of this project in texas
project	project_nou	and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project and and then how to paint it with the tole paintings
project	project_nou	and i was down there with a program from the college that i went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries and study the language and then do a little service project
project	project_nou	oh well i hope your project turns out great
project	project_nou	well that sounds like a pretty good project
project	project_nou	and but we do test after during the assembly project product um
project	project_nou	maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing
project	project_nou	and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too or whatever
project	project_nou	and uh uh so we are doing it to raise money for uh a large project at church
project	project_nou	and you have to do a public service project uh in which leadership is the key element
project	project_nou	the first project i started out one was a big one
progress	progress_nou	uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster
progress	progress_nou	and i was very pleased with their development and their progress
progress	progress_nou	we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
progress	progress_nou	having a daughter who has gone into this into engineering i sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than i did
progress	progress_nou	so that s that s progress i guess
progress	progress_nou	but i think we <unk> finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
produce	produce_vrb	well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of of say a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for uh <unk> that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in texas and california
produce	produce_vrb	and i hope maybe we <unk> going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh reagan s uh new education secretary and uh you know trying to do some uh trying to produce some new programs anyway
produce	produce_vrb	the the difficulty with with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good
produce	produce_vrb	what s bad for the soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should
produce	produce_vrb	and if he ca n't produce evidence not argument but evidence
produce	produce_vrb	the only commitments that they <unk> interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to mars which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth
produce	produce_vrb	but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
progress	progress_vrb	i think that s what made us uh progress to the state we are is our curiosity
protest	protest_vrb	and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they <unk> really concerned about their rights or whether they <unk> really concerned about something else
protest	protest_vrb	and the city workers uh took them to court to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first a the the search and seizure amendment
present	present_adj-nou	and we at the present time do not have random testing
present	present_adj-nou	which is exactly what businesses do at the present
present	present_adj-nou	but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what uh pertains to my daily life at the present time
present	present_adj-nou	and you buy a present
present	present_adj-nou	i told him <unk> if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a <unk>
present	present_adj-nou	and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh prevail
present	present_adj-nou	of course uh you being from new mexico you <unk> probably been n to washington especially if you <unk> your present location
present	present_adj-nou	but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than most people probably <unk> might be in terms of keeping keeping score of input and output
present	present_adj-nou	but then so i took the ones from fifty two on to the present
present	present_adj-nou	you know so uh the only thing we <unk> you know that we do now is uh i keep a a little spread sheet of uh what i call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth
present	present_adj-nou	and then we have to take another one that s mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present
present	present_adj-nou	how are we supposed to present the imagine that we <unk> supposed to present with equipment that s outdated that s obsolete
present	present_adj-nou	uh it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present
present	present_adj-nou	and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home
present	present_adj-nou	well it was the equivalent of a christmas present
present	present_adj-nou	and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
present	present_adj-nou	now i was warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a uh witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time
present	present_adj-nou	well at the present time i have two dogs
produce	produce_nou	a lot of um of a um winter produce comes from south america
protest	protest_nou	and there was a lot of protest
rebel	rebel_vrb	if i feel too obligated to do it i start to rebel
rebel	rebel_vrb	but you see president bush is telling them rebel you know uh uprise
reject	reject_vrb	do you think it s okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they <unk> take drugs
reject	reject_vrb	and uh places like j c penney s that they <unk> reject the seconds
refuse	refuse_vrb	so i refuse to have one in the house
refuse	refuse_vrb	you can always refuse
refuse	refuse_vrb	now if they do n't i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them
refuse	refuse_vrb	and i just refuse
refuse	refuse_vrb	once i found out that that s really not necessary or legal then i just refuse
record	record_vrb	and now you <unk> singing all this stuff that does n't matter what you what you sing or what you record
record	record_vrb	i did n't want to interfere with whatever they <unk> trying to record
record	record_vrb	and they record it
record	record_vrb	sometimes it s better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one
refuse	refuse_nou	but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh a bend that we put things in for <unk> these other things
refuse	refuse_nou	and uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse
rebel	rebel_nou	my husband is always you know talked about texas being a uh rebel state
read	read_past	it s been it s been a while since i read the dallas news
read	read_past	two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book
read	read_past	have you ever read anything by susan <unk>
read	read_past	i read a thing
read	read_past	but i i i <unk> never read a newspaper in my entire life
read	read_past	i just read one about grace kelley
read	read_past	i think i read oh
read	read_past	i think i read about that in the paper
read	read_past	well i guess i i guess it was because i d read the book before i saw the movie
read	read_past	i read about how they did uh an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine
read	read_past	i think the last novel i read i read i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year
read	read_past	i think the last novel i read i read i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year
read	read_past	i read about that
read	read_past	one in real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job
read	read_past	and i just realized i had never read it growing up
read	read_past	i guess i watch t v if i have n't read the paper that day
read	read_past	i read the book
read	read_past	you know <unk> um i read a book one time or a m a magazine article
read	read_past	oh my mom and dad read all the time
read	read_past	i i m just read two books
read	read_past	on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the amelia earhart story whatever happened with her
read	read_past	an another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they <unk> out there i guess is the car designers uh are starting to design cars with women in mind
read	read_past	and i ca n't remember what i read about that
read	read_past	i <unk> read polls now where they <unk> excused him because there was a a definite necessity to balance the budget
read	read_past	i have n't heard of anybody that s read it either
read	read_past	i mean i <unk> read that is a theory
read	read_past	now not too many people have read that one i do n't think
read	read_past	but what i <unk> read about it they talk about that
read	read_past	and so we were ready to look up the places we read about
read	read_past	and uh nowadays the latest thing i <unk> i <unk> read about in the paper here that they <unk> doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house
read	read_past	you know that i read in people or somewhere no it was u s a today
read	read_past	have you read that
read	read_past	so i i read a lot of that
read	read_past	i have n't read a book in a long time
read	read_past	i had read something one time
read	read_past	well i <unk> done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people
read	read_past	and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten <unk> buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
read	read_past	um a couple years ago i guess well maybe ten years ago i i had read bury my heart at wounded knee
read	read_past	i <unk> read some things about him that he was he was n't too good himself
read	read_past	i d read one book i think it was calls trial by jury of all things that uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at what had at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations
read	read_past	and right now my list of books to be read have to do with uh the art of selling
read	read_past	have you read the silence of the lambs
read	read_past	and uh i read it and really liked it
read	read_past	i i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh that uh
read	read_past	i just read about that the other day
read	read_past	as a matter of fact i read in the sports page this morning
read	read_past	it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the ca only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway
read	read_past	but i i read that uh
read	read_past	you know i read you know
read	read_past	or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they <unk> read probably a thousand times that day already
read	read_past	i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school
read	read_past	i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school
read	read_past	i <unk> never read a whole one of hers i do n't think
read	read_past	a woman was raped in richardson i read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now
read	read_past	because i i think i was i think i read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college
read	read_past	never read it
read	read_past	i actually thought i d read that too

read	read_past	even having read the book and i <unk> read that book probably three times watching that movie i could n't figure out what they were talking about at all
read	read_past	even having read the book and i <unk> read that book probably three times watching that movie i could n't figure out what they were talking about at all
read	read_past	and after i i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too uh
read	read_past	i <unk> read that one too

read	read_past	i have n't read that
read	read_past	well you know i think i read about that too
read	read_past	i i read to them a lot
read	read_past	and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse
read	read_past	what kind of things have you read
read	read_past	when i read it i should have realized that because i mean it had foster s style written all over it
read	read_past	well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with
read	read_past	you know i read a study once
read	read_past	i had read um the last picture show
read	read_past	so what s the latest one you <unk> read
read	read_past	i uh fact last time i read the dallas dallas news i was in arkansas

read	read_past	and i read the book from that
read	read_past	and i read in this article i could n't believe it where you know like one cow produces like a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure
read	read_past	but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i had n't read something before then
read	read_past	you have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth
read	read_past	i <unk> always read the new york times when i was younger
read	read_past	um and i only bring up wounded knee because that was what ten years ago you read and and understood you know about the american pop indian population
read	read_past	but that s the last thing i i <unk> read
read	read_past	and i think that s probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that i <unk> ever read
read	read_past	and now i <unk> like a said i <unk> read a lot of self self help books
read	read_past	and i took a novel with me uh and read it at thanksgiving time
read	read_past	well i had n't read it
read	read_past	well i i guess i just have not read <unk>
read	read_past	i read that what uganda and
read	read_past	of course during the <unk> when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on
record	record_nou	but i mean uh baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year
record	record_nou	he got a bonus record
record	record_nou	and then they check you out and make sure you do n't have a record you know and things like that
record	record_nou	let me ask by the way just for the record
record	record_nou	matter of fact i <unk> heard that i <unk> heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
record	record_nou	and we set a record yesterday
record	record_nou	so i think it is probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record
record	record_nou	uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to
record	record_nou	since i have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess i can go back and look
record	record_nou	one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an n b a record for seventy wins in a season
record	record_nou	actually i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it s a record of everything
record	record_nou	and he s got this clean record
record	record_nou	and they said the record showed i served
record	record_nou	well actually i m i m i <unk> heard on the news that we uh will be setting a record here in the state of texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture we <unk> had this year that it s going to break all kind of records that were set set set back since nineteen thirty two
record	record_nou	well the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle
record	record_nou	when uh i was at t i the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes
record	record_nou	and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
record	record_nou	but um i guess we <unk> changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody s record
record	record_nou	the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company
record	record_nou	and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like no jacket required
record	record_nou	and you see seventy <unk> a a lot at at the stores a a at record stores
record	record_nou	i think your record should stand for itself that you know if you <unk> been tested at other companies and you <unk> always come up negative or whatever then i do n't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over
record	record_nou	i think there s a check for <unk> felonies on your record
record	record_nou	um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
record	record_nou	that that whole record was pretty good
record	record_nou	i found a record that i had i travel in europe a lot and i what i had paid for hotels
record	record_nou	and they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there
record	record_nou	he s a record collector and a hot wheels collector
record	record_nou	and you know this area where record retention is there s only a few people that work there
resume	resume_nou	i think it will become resume writing
resume	resume_nou	um my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things uh his resume his uh letter
resume	resume_nou	though i would put it on my resume what program i went to
resume	resume_nou	i m just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at digital
refund	refund_nou	nice nice to get a refund
refund	refund_nou	she gets a refund check
read	read_present	what do you like to read
read	read_present	i you know i like to read articles about things that matter
read	read_present	but but i do read it too
read	read_present	but uh and when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
read	read_present	she started some type of um national organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards you know helpful things
read	read_present	and uh i like to read a novel every now and then
read	read_present	if i read three articles in in you know one of the journals i figure you know i did really well
read	read_present	because i guess everywhere i read that there is a shortage of judges
read	read_present	well what newspapers uh do you read in dallas
read	read_present	and um i i like to uh read about people who have been a successful you know who who made a success of their lives
read	read_present	uh but i read you know
read	read_present	and it and it s kind of short because we do n't woe do n't have a lot of time to to read
read	read_present	read my lips or whatever
read	read_present	the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh uh i guess
read	read_present	i like i like to read some of the philosophy stuff
read	read_present	but it seems as though if you really want to set a t side time to read the bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
read	read_present	i read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff
read	read_present	and if you read national surveys they <unk> far from it
read	read_present	and i guess i do read that
read	read_present	so sounds like you like to read
read	read_present	did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject
read	read_present	i read uh a lot of steven king dean r koontz uh some danielle steel
read	read_present	and i read you know how our politicians voted each week in the paper
read	read_present	i <unk> read a lot of his too
read	read_present	i <unk> read that one too
read	read_present	i mean i read a lot for school
read	read_present	and sometimes i <unk> read like the uh wall street or the new york times
read	read_present	oh i just read for escape
read	read_present	i must have a list of oh two hundred three hundred books that i want to read
read	read_present	i love to read about real people
read	read_present	but you do n't read many sports books
read	read_present	but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write
read	read_present	every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you <unk> see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men
read	read_present	and i like to read stuff like that
read	read_present	and i read magazines and such
read	read_present	do you ever read
read	read_present	and they truly ca n't read
read	read_present	i read to escape
read	read_present	and i occasionally will read something like the new york review of books
read	read_present	so i keep getting stacks of books i need to read
read	read_present	so you know people who do n't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
read	read_present	because they ca n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know
read	read_present	my oldest daughter had to read lost horizons for her english class
read	read_present	and as long as both were given you basically just do n't read the kilometers per hour
read	read_present	i i feel like it s important for young children to read too
read	read_present	and i read it on the way in to work on the in a <unk>
read	read_present	i like to read a lot of non fiction history when civil war era and and that kind of thing
read	read_present	and i found that i really did n't have time at home since i work to read them
read	read_present	but now you know you would n't probably read about it here in texas
read	read_present	you just say well look read the miles per hour one
read	read_present	um i will read our current letters that come out on elections
read	read_present	i do n't have time to read the book
read	read_present	i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and uh pay and exhaustion and you know things like that rather than these uh uh really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
read	read_present	i uh i read a lot
read	read_present	i read quite a bit probably do n't read as much as i would like to
read	read_present	i read quite a bit probably do n't read as much as i would like to
read	read_present	i <unk> always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um because i enjoyed some of those stories so much
read	read_present	i i think uh in a way we <unk> able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i m upset and i know when she s not feeling good too
read	read_present	i uh fear for the russians from what i read you know
read	read_present	now that it has a national edition i read that
read	read_present	at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their uh out of their uh budget
read	read_present	you know i read one about bob hope that i liked
read	read_present	or what you read
read	read_present	oh i do n't even have <unk> time to read the newspaper except in passing
read	read_present	we read we read the uh d magazine
read	read_present	we read we read the uh d magazine
read	read_present	i do n't uh subscribe to any magazines at home because we get so many at work that uh i need to read that uh i just do n't take any at home
read	read_present	so i really do n't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
read	read_present	but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the bible
read	read_present	but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the bible
read	read_present	and i like to read uh i like to read some self help books like uh
read	read_present	and i like to read uh i like to read some self help books like uh
read	read_present	and i i read a lot for school
read	read_present	i read a lot of science fiction
read	read_present	but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read
read	read_present	you <unk> be able to read off of it
read	read_present	are they because i could n't read it
read	read_present	and i have to read the magazines you know such as <unk> and computer world and mac world and all of these uh magazines such as that
read	read_present	i have n't i have n't had a chance to read a lot lately either
read	read_present	and and usually once in a while he <unk> read the story to little one
read	read_present	i think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self <unk> i would probably be turned off to them
read	read_present	i read a lot
read	read_present	i do n't know that i read anything strictly labeled self improvement
read	read_present	and uh i like to read you know <unk>
read	read_present	i <unk> got the every day i <unk> got to uh read to kindergartners
read	read_present	i i read as i said and uh quite a bit
read	read_present	and they are telling that they do n't know how to read you know
read	read_present	uh i mean i i read now where we are you know
read	read_present	do you ever read cosmo
read	read_present	but they do read uh where a lot of people do n't have any interest in it at all
read	read_present	well the thing i really worry about is uh the sexual abuse cases you read about
read	read_present	i used to like to read about royalty a lot
read	read_present	do you read um
read	read_present	but but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know which it <unk> i mean it sounds like uh
read	read_present	and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know
read	read_present	i mean uh eh eh eh i i i i tend to read like only out of a couple you know groups
read	read_present	did you ever read the uh uh oh
read	read_present	i do n't read as much as i would like to either
read	read_present	and i do n't read any parents magazines either
read	read_present	i was going to read while it was on
read	read_present	what kind of books do you like to read
read	read_present	so i tend to read a lot of the baseball books
read	read_present	mainly i read the bible these days
read	read_present	well i do n't read all that much for enjoyment
read	read_present	it s getting to where a just really want to read it
read	read_present	it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because you know it was uh if you read it it only emancipated those who were in areas uh in rebellion against the united states
read	read_present	i i did n't read the story
read	read_present	these some of these young kids you read about just does n't bother them to kill someone at all
read	read_present	if i if i go on an airplane ride or something i <unk> stop in and pick up a you know a cosmopolitan or something to read on the airplane
read	read_present	i like to read too
read	read_present	because i i think i was i think i read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college
read	read_present	and uh i read a lot of science fiction
read	read_present	for example so i can read a certain business or topics
read	read_present	and of course we always read a bedtime story at night
read	read_present	do you read
read	read_present	i mean i read a lot
read	read_present	do you read
read	read_present	i kind of like to read different stuff
read	read_present	i i m i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them
read	read_present	but i do n't i do n't read a whole
read	read_present	but then on the other extreme i like to read uh uh i guess <unk> i do n't know horror steven king type books
read	read_present	which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things
read	read_present	i used to read a lot of uh novels
read	read_present	i m <unk> read it fast and put it down
read	read_present	i get a <unk> every week which i i pretty much read that cover to cover
read	read_present	in fact i d rather read sometimes than watch t v
read	read_present	if you <unk> only got a short time to read
read	read_present	good housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for when uh when i m really have time and i really want to read something you know
read	read_present	and i like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what s going on in the world
read	read_present	so i figured i might get me one of those because we do n't always read the newspaper
read	read_present	uh a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that for you know because i do n't have a lot of time
read	read_present	i usually read that from cover to cover
read	read_present	what what uh newspapers do you read
read	read_present	and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
read	read_present	you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on
read	read_present	well sometimes if you know if you <unk> in transportation in public transportation i know that people will read them on something like that
read	read_present	just to read them
read	read_present	i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again
read	read_present	so it s no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure
read	read_present	i read the daily newspaper uh the houston chronicle
read	read_present	and we were laughing that we d have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine
read	read_present	i have n't read any
read	read_present	but i do n't i do n't read newspapers
read	read_present	and i i been praying that god would put a desire to read the bible in my heart
read	read_present	well that s another one i read
read	read_present	it s because they ca n't read
read	read_present	i always try to read the sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the the week s hot events
read	read_present	adults that is ca n't even read
read	read_present	i read i read the newspapers sometimes
read	read_present	i read i read the newspapers sometimes
read	read_present	i read about one or two thick novels like that a year you know
read	read_present	well we do n't we do n't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home t to read it
read	read_present	and i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
read	read_present	but then when it started i just could n't you know read
read	read_present	did you read that one
read	read_present	but uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read
read	read_present	do you like to read mysteries
read	read_present	and then when jennie had to read it at gettysburg and i got her the i got her someone
read	read_present	do you read
read	read_present	not if you can read or write or do or <unk> understand some science
read	read_present	so that should be one article that i <unk> read anyway
read	read_present	and then i i read a lot
read	read_present	you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases
read	read_present	you know and if you do n't if you do n't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you <unk> in the car all the time
read	read_present	so i do n't know how they expect them to uh pass history when they ca n't read anything you know even read a word problem in math
read	read_present	so i do n't know how they expect them to uh pass history when they ca n't read anything you know even read a word problem in math
read	read_present	and what you read to them
read	read_present	i used to read every month a reader s digest
read	read_present	since i <unk> been getting the journal like maybe maybe i <unk> read two maybe three
read	read_present	oh me i uh good grief i read the times los angeles times
read	read_present	but a lot of the times i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper
read	read_present	i do n't really read the self improvement books or things like that
read	read_present	and that s what made me want to read the book
read	read_present	because uh i love to read his his uh children s books just
read	read_present	i read an awful lot of uh periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference books
read	read_present	oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that
read	read_present	and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know
read	read_present	they they want to sit down in front of the <unk> and uh or at a read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every
read	read_present	they they want to sit down in front of the <unk> and uh or at a read a magazine or u s a today and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every
read	read_present	and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity uh
read	read_present	so i frequently purchase and read uh books mainly on water color because that s my big interest at the moment
read	read_present	and uh i read magazines mainly because they <unk> fast and if i want to relax while i watch t v
read	read_present	it it it s uh it s hard for me to find time also to read
read	read_present	and if something caught my eye then i might read something
read	read_present	and for the longer term i i read uh like scientific american and and uh readers digest and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they
read	read_present	and it was like uh i want to read something else for a while
read	read_present	you know if i want something intellectual i usually read a book
read	read_present	just like <unk> i want to read that
read	read_present	and uh you know where our kids might be in a great school we <unk> still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read you know
read	read_present	i do n't know if you read skip bayless but a a local commentary
read	read_present	otherwise if if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf i <unk> pick it up then rather than having them delivered and think oh i really need to read this
read	read_present	otherwise if if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf i <unk> pick it up then rather than having them delivered and think oh i really need to read this
read	read_present	i m not saying they read all the right things
read	read_present	that s that s pretty low that there s forty eight countries ahead of us that have more <unk> more citizens percentage wise that can read and write
read	read_present	and i read the front page of the wall street journal most every day
read	read_present	and i said you know you need to either read neal sperry s book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there
read	read_present	you know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert
read	read_present	but uh i have got a lot of books that i i intend to read
read	read_present	and i read the newspaper
read	read_present	and so i often drop in on a break and and read it
read	read_present	i used to read just mainly <unk> fiction
read	read_present	i do see a problem with graduating people that that ca n't read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves
read	read_present	i did n't read see the the movie
read	read_present	i read to my daughter a lot too
read	read_present	i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then
read	read_present	do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
read	read_present	and uh the last uh i m embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i can not right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the <unk> uh lone star or the the texas history book
read	read_present	well read my lips
read	read_present	i read the wall street journal
read	read_present	so it s it s hard for me to sit down and read
read	read_present	and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just i m reading so much all the time
read	read_present	and anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always so uh covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i do n't have much confidence in it
read	read_present	i also read uh i i i guess i do watch uh <unk> <unk> on p b s because i i lean to that coverage
read	read_present	well did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the teach the administrators pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers
read	read_present	do you read the wall street journal
read	read_present	i know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
read	read_present	um i guess i <unk> got so many books like that that i need to read
read	read_present	a lot of people just do n't have time to read nowadays
read	read_present	but uh gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what to do with my garden
read	read_present	and and i guess when it comes to um to magazines i do n't read
read	read_present	and uh i read good housekeeping and better homes and <unk> s
read	read_present	i find i i read very little
read	read_present	and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
read	read_present	you ca n't read labels
read	read_present	did n't i read that
read	read_present	and i like to read
read	read_present	because i i just live to read
read	read_present	i do n't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday
read	read_present	one in five americans ca n't read
reading	reading_en	i i was reading the other day about uh corpus christi texas which has the the highest
reading	reading_en	uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new <unk>
reading	reading_en	oh you know reading is so good
reading	reading_en	but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading
reading	reading_en	i was reading
reading	reading_en	that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that
reading	reading_en	and i started reading and got about sixty pages into it
reading	reading_en	as a matter of fact he s reading on level
reading	reading_en	but it seems as though if you really want to set a t side time to read the bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
reading	reading_en	well i was just reading an article in uh a north carolina <unk> paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities
reading	reading_en	but i was interested in reading <unk> before i saw the movie
reading	reading_en	not only am am i <unk> reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisers for this um journal does n't have right now does n't have a really respected name um who s a uh a scholar on on music
reading	reading_en	you get so involved in what you <unk> reading
reading	reading_en	well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that s what i m involved in a lot at work
reading	reading_en	here again it s it s casual reading
reading	reading_en	and i uh of course i do n't ever get around to reading them
reading	reading_en	and i think that that s why reading is so important
reading	reading_en	or farm work in world war one i remember uh reading about
reading	reading_en	i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going to sign him
reading	reading_en	i <unk> actually i am reading a couple of different books uh
reading	reading_en	but gee i just do n't have much time for enjoyment reading
reading	reading_en	uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading
reading	reading_en	reading the little words at the bottom of the screen
reading	reading_en	so i just finished reading that for enjoyment
reading	reading_en	so i do n't know why what that was reading it for
reading	reading_en	and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten <unk> buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
reading	reading_en	so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but looking through them
reading	reading_en	there s one that i m reading right now
reading	reading_en	that s good fun reading
reading	reading_en	i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when some people first tried that
reading	reading_en	but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning
reading	reading_en	but but it is good reading
reading	reading_en	he did n't have a problem with reading
reading	reading_en	i was just reading an article uh that there were nineteen thousand properties available in texas uh for sale by the <unk> resolution trust <unk> corporation
reading	reading_en	it it s very a typical for my reading though
reading	reading_en	but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that i <unk> really gotten into reading and i think this is because the kids are getting to me is science fiction
reading	reading_en	or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they <unk> read probably a thousand times that day already
reading	reading_en	but uh i mean they they say it s like the sixth grade reading level
reading	reading_en	i d say reading is probably one of my biggest ones because it s the type of thing that you can you can do a little bit at a time whereas
reading	reading_en	i spend a lot of time reading about these things
reading	reading_en	therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide
reading	reading_en	but it s nice light reading
reading	reading_en	and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
reading	reading_en	i just think uh you know it s it s light reading
reading	reading_en	and she s already reading and writing and stuff like that
reading	reading_en	interestingly some of the information i <unk> been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary
reading	reading_en	well i was reading the book
reading	reading_en	and we make experts by reading books
reading	reading_en	you <unk> reading dune
reading	reading_en	i uh i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little
reading	reading_en	and you kind of forget the fun of reading
reading	reading_en	i was reading through a book on uh <unk> human <unk> research
reading	reading_en	so a lot of the books i <unk> been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues
reading	reading_en	i remember reading in the paper a few months back
reading	reading_en	and uh i think they <unk> all developed kind of an interest in reading also
reading	reading_en	i m reading the lion and the wind right now
reading	reading_en	and all i do is teach reading all day long
reading	reading_en	i m uh uh actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading <unk> digest
reading	reading_en	but it s well it s kind of it s kind of like reading magazines any more
reading	reading_en	and uh i was reading dune which seeming rather ironic
reading	reading_en	uh right now i m occasionally reading on a book about uh the mardi gras in new orleans and its history
reading	reading_en	if i start into something and i really enjoy what i m reading then i have a terrible time getting away from it too
reading	reading_en	um i do n't do as much reading like i say as i would like to
reading	reading_en	if i m really interested in what i m reading i mean hours can go by
reading	reading_en	that is what i have been reading
reading	reading_en	i mean if you do n't mind reading subtitles
reading	reading_en	and it s really excellent fast reading
reading	reading_en	they actually should do some reading
reading	reading_en	i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the montgomery county public schools makes
reading	reading_en	but um just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
reading	reading_en	but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
reading	reading_en	and and i m getting rather good at reading want ads
reading	reading_en	but uh that s mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this
reading	reading_en	i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing
reading	reading_en	i m um i have just started reading a book
reading	reading_en	is is that just the only type of reading you <unk> been doing
reading	reading_en	but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody
reading	reading_en	it s it s hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment
reading	reading_en	it s it s hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment
reading	reading_en	i was reading that in the supermarket line
reading	reading_en	just joy reading
reading	reading_en	but i have always loved reading
reading	reading_en	i started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it
reading	reading_en	and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just i m reading so much all the time
reading	reading_en	and that s about it because otherwise i m reading so much for school
reading	reading_en	and uh one thing they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing
reading	reading_en	and um they say that the average english student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago
reading	reading_en	so i like reading those to her
reading	reading_en	but uh i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
reading	reading_en	that what i <unk> been reading lately a lot of
reading	reading_en	so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know different ones
reading	reading_en	i was reading something in uh consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact
reading	reading_en	uh i i do n't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the <unk> on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not
reading	reading_en	uh i was reading a an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that s going
reading	reading_en	and i tried uh reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it
reading	reading_en	i d say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic in grade school
reading	reading_en	even if you took speed reading huh
reading	reading_en	i uh was reading in uh a book
reading	reading_en	i think it was um oh some actress reading it
reading	reading_en	i was reading when you called
reading	reading_en	and i have just now gotten around to reading it
row	row_1	and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth
row	row_1	and they showed all five in a row
row	row_1	and then they won five or six in a row
row	row_1	he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing
row	row_1	he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing
row	row_1	he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing
row	row_1	and i was n't very <unk> at that duty for two years in a row
row	row_1	you know that s that s no kind of deterrent because we we <unk> got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row
row	row_1	you know that s that s no kind of deterrent because we we <unk> got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row
row	row_1	and the thing that i did n't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row uh time wise they happen one after another and just no no time between them
row	row_1	and we play three days in a row three different courses
row	row_1	there was like a fan at the very end of the row
row	row_1	he s sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people
row	row_1	what s amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
row	row_1	when i was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the houston oilers
row	row_1	you know a a a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i <unk> seen
row	row_1	and i never have figured out how he won uh entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row
row	row_1	and the uh the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death you know he s been on death row for like eight years
row	row_1	and as a matter of fact i <unk> already done a second row of radishes
row	row_1	that s the second or third year in a row that we <unk> had a real rainy spring
row	row_1	they wo n't let you on death row
sake	sake	it s going just for the sake of getting together
sake	sake	for heaven s sake
sake	sake	i do n't very often do things for the sake of exercise
sake	sake	and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising s sake
subject	subject_vrb	but again to require you know such a test and <unk> and then to make make it <unk> is to subject them to to <unk> discriminatory practices and other things
subject	subject_vrb	so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
suspect	suspect_vrb	and i think that s the only reason i have a problem with it when there s no you know there s no reason to suspect someone you know
suspect	suspect_vrb	uh i suspect that the yeah that that that that s not the thing that they that they do n't feel it s open to them
suspect	suspect_vrb	uh i suspect i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that s the direction we should look
suspect	suspect_vrb	um so i suspect that that s one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators
suspect	suspect_vrb	the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it
suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect you i suspect you have
suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect you i suspect you have
suspect	suspect_vrb	but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either
suspect	suspect_vrb	and i suspect that that s probably true for everyone
suspect	suspect_vrb	uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off
suspect	suspect_vrb	i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part
suspect	suspect_vrb	well i suspect that it is possible
suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect that the <unk> that there s going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it
suspect	suspect_vrb	i suspect they <unk> fairly simple because the one lady i <unk> seen i know that does it i <unk> never asked her any questions
suspect	suspect_vrb	well i suspect that we <unk> probably covered everything that we need to here
suspect	suspect_vrb	so i suspect that it s it s an ever growing problem
separate	separate_vrb	uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers
separate	separate_vrb	uh there s too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff
separate	separate_vrb	but in uh in the paper one you have to separate
separate	separate_vrb	and you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum
separate	separate_vrb	separate them
separate	separate_vrb	and we have to separate our papers and our glass
separate	separate_vrb	you know they really did separate them well
separate	separate_vrb	they separate them as they as they you know dump them
separate	separate_vrb	and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it
separate	separate_vrb	and that s real discouraging thinking you <unk> sitting there working to separate it
separate	separate_vrb	the law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous acts are done to uh to you know to get somebody into a a situation where they <unk> going to be guilty of of a crime
separate	separate_vrb	but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know
separate	separate_vrb	i really do n't understand that part on what they <unk> told you to separate everything
separate	separate_vrb	and you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a <unk> you know which is a real pain
separate	separate_vrb	we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
separate	separate_adj	and you know there s part either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have
separate	separate_adj	sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl
separate	separate_adj	i m not sure all what we <unk> going to have to do whether we have three separate containers
separate	separate_adj	but i m getting two separate <unk> machines also
separate	separate_adj	and someone else is n't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags
separate	separate_adj	and he went to a a separate drug testing firm
separate	separate_adj	and uh you know the type of facilities whether it s a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom
separate	separate_adj	and then i buy the bibs separate
separate	separate_adj	the city brought ought you know set <unk> separate trash cans
separate	separate_adj	like you have a separate account for that then
separate	separate_adj	did did they separate them by age group
separate	separate_adj	and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters
separate	separate_adj	well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in
separate	separate_adj	they have this day now that it s you know separate from the other trash pick up
separate	separate_adj	and then how many a a freezer separate from
separate	separate_adj	but then if you deteriorate um they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time
sow	sow	but that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow
subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess i i got to say if that s the subject if the subject is do i feel that we <unk> well enough equipped to
subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess i i got to say if that s the subject if the subject is do i feel that we <unk> well enough equipped to
subject	subject_adj-nou	and also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
subject	subject_adj-nou	uh this is a little bit of the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	well anyway we <unk> got a easy subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	and uh it does n't matter who they put in office they <unk> going to fall subject to uh the pressure that the lobbyists can put
subject	subject_adj-nou	when they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank
subject	subject_adj-nou	this is really ironic that this would i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away
subject	subject_adj-nou	well this is a subject that you never think you <unk> be assigned to one that kind of comes up when you <unk> lost it the others other subjects
subject	subject_adj-nou	but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what uh pertains to my daily life at the present time
subject	subject_adj-nou	but uh i do n't know how we got the subject <unk>
subject	subject_adj-nou	well uh <unk> how do you view this whole subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	so this is probably a real hard subject for you
subject	subject_adj-nou	well it s kind of a broad subject uh
subject	subject_adj-nou	stick on the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	lot of lot of interesting <unk> things i think would be a good be a good change if we <unk> going to be talking about the subject t tonight which in some i guess criminal courts the
subject	subject_adj-nou	anyway what are your what are your first comments on that subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	is that what you <unk> you <unk> thinking the subject is about
subject	subject_adj-nou	but um this is not on the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	and i thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	and they ca n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line
subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess we <unk> kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we
subject	subject_adj-nou	um i guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work
subject	subject_adj-nou	i guess tonight s subject is uh woodworking
subject	subject_adj-nou	the subject is is big city crime which is something that i do n't have any first hand experiences about
subject	subject_adj-nou	that was the primary subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	and i like them because they <unk> kind of short and to the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	but this was n't a good subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	it s a fun subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	well on this subject i really had n't had to deal with putting someone in there yet
subject	subject_adj-nou	well on this subject of invasion of privacy
subject	subject_adj-nou	i think that s what the subject is about
subject	subject_adj-nou	well i i think we <unk> covered the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know
subject	subject_adj-nou	well i i <unk> been uh i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	uh i love the irony of uh talking about this subject on april the fifteenth
subject	subject_adj-nou	well trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
subject	subject_adj-nou	you think about this when you come to when it comes to a subject like that
subject	subject_adj-nou	when this subject was mentioned to us i said well i went gee that s all i use mine for is a word <unk>
subject	subject_adj-nou	cause i wondered when they <unk> taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that
subject	subject_adj-nou	see this is n't a subject that i think a lot about because i m never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
subject	subject_adj-nou	well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh nickie
subject	subject_adj-nou	and uh but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is
subject	subject_adj-nou	boy speaking of denver on another subject i <unk> been up there like five times in the last three four weeks
subject	subject_adj-nou	but whether it s something that they can put to to economic use later on is a different subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	but any rate that s off the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	well do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	uh also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen
subject	subject_adj-nou	i agree with you on that particular subject there
subject	subject_adj-nou	that s pretty interesting because just just because you know a subject matter does n't mean you can teach it
subject	subject_adj-nou	have you ever had a uh it s kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood <unk> done recently or since you <unk> been biking to see if it
subject	subject_adj-nou	boy current events is not a good subject for me
subject	subject_adj-nou	it seems that d be a subject that i i do n't have much to say on
subject	subject_adj-nou	and that s that same subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	uh well i i guess it s a subject i have n't thought too much about
subject	subject_adj-nou	but uh that s mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this
subject	subject_adj-nou	let me ask you a question off the subject though
subject	subject_adj-nou	this is a different subject though
subject	subject_adj-nou	you probably uh more up on this subject than i am
subject	subject_adj-nou	well carol since today s subject is our homes
subject	subject_adj-nou	how did you know to choose this subject tonight
subject	subject_adj-nou	but that s a whole different subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	well do you have any uh opinion on the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	well i do n't i mean i do n't know what you think about the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	you know when that subject comes up they can say yes
subject	subject_adj-nou	i mean it was what i liked about it was that it was a new subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	well back to the original subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	here i m getting off the subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i do n't know if i d know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids
subject	subject_adj-nou	and and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed because it s subject to abuse
subject	subject_adj-nou	well this is a good subject is n't it
subject	subject_adj-nou	they need exposure to every subject
subject	subject_adj-nou	and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by texas then you had a built in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject
supplement	supplement_vrb	so i have to find a way to supplement that
supplement	supplement_vrb	and i was thinking you know maybe i d help supplement it you know when they turned them in
supplement	supplement_vrb	i think they have uh a one that we need to recognize that we <unk> going to have to supplement ourselves
suspect	suspect_vrb	and and so i but i i suspect a number of them
suspect	suspect_vrb	and i suspect it in cases like
suspect	suspect_vrb	he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect
tear	tear_vrb	it s it s seen some wear and tear you know
tear	tear_vrb	or it <unk> it <unk> tear up a nice tiller
tear	tear_vrb	there s never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers
tear	tear_vrb	you can always tear stuff out and <unk> it
transplant	transplant_nou	um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant
transport	transport_nou	uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that i think we should be doing
wind	wind_vrb	you know because you know because uh the country s going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients
wind	wind_vrb	they <unk> come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it s time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that
wind	wind_vrb	it could really wind up
wind	wind_vrb	uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away and just wind up having to kiss your ass good <unk> you know
wind	wind_vrb	and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth
wind	wind_vrb	and you wind up waiting about an hour
wind	wind_vrb	and uh i find if you <unk> not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face
wind	wind_vrb	we all need that time just some quiet time to wind down from the day
wind	wind_vrb	and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress and seeing like all
wind	wind_vrb	because people that uh do n't make very much money wind up spending it all
wind	wind_vrb	and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in mesquite who was out in six months
wind	wind_vrb	and so i wind up going out camping with uh a bunch of boys at one time
wind	wind_vrb	so i wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding
wind	wind_vrb	uh well um first off we d probably wind up with a a cat or maybe a puppy
wind	wind_vrb	and uh still you wind up meeting people you uh you never knew you were related to let alone
wind	wind_vrb	but we have such an affluent a society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a a cure for just about everything
wind	wind_vrb	and and it was a little bit hard to uh wind down
wind	wind_vrb	a a as soon as we wind up uh uh you know for
wind	wind_vrb	you know it s going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states are n't doing it at the same time
wind	wind_vrb	and you know they <unk> they <unk> wind up being good again
wind	wind_vrb	what did you wind up with
winds	winds_vrb	and she winds up being a a victim day after day after day
winds	winds_vrb	but uh the guy winds up getting hurt every other game
winds	winds_vrb	and it <unk> it was really funny it s uh that that he winds up playing in the movie
winds	winds_vrb	first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan
wound	wound_vrb	so wound up back about two hundred miles aware away from where we started out
wound	wound_vrb	and uh our cats wound up getting fleas uh from the apartment that we were in
wound	wound_vrb	we wound up just choosing a another mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into
wound	wound_vrb	so it s uh wound up that uh we <unk> the old folks now
wound	wound_vrb	but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away
wound	wound_vrb	and he <unk> he wound up pull
wound	wound_vrb	i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the problem because we <unk> so wound up in the in the system that we <unk> got that you know trying to convert over
wound	wound_vrb	wound up in administration
wound	wound_vrb	but course it s one of these with a twist where it looks like he s the one that wound up killing her
wound	wound_vrb	we wound up selling the house
wound	wound_vrb	we <unk> wound up sending in one
wound	wound_vrb	and so it kind of wound down
wound	wound_vrb	but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for
wind	wind_nou	and during uh certain wind directions because we get the uh gary indiana chicago pollution
wind	wind_nou	i ca n't remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind was n't blowing
wind	wind_nou	couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid <unk> and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side
wind	wind_nou	to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were tacking back and forth
wind	wind_nou	and we went to hear uh james wind ensemble concert
wind	wind_nou	it depends which way the wind s blowing from boston cause we <unk> like forty miles south of boston
wind	wind_nou	what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed wind direction
wind	wind_nou	what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed wind direction
wind	wind_nou	and and the wind and the blowing snow and everything
wind	wind_nou	but i m sure i lot of it s filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind of what they <unk> missing out on
wind	wind_nou	i m reading the lion and the wind right now
wind	wind_nou	and uh the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing
wind	wind_nou	and the wind came in from the north
wind	wind_nou	i could do with a little less wind
wind	wind_nou	we <unk> had a lot of wind around here
wind	wind_nou	it s amazing to me because i have only lived in dallas for three years and i can not believe that the wind blows all the time
wind	wind_nou	and and the <unk> and a wind storm come and knock it down
wind	wind_nou	but the the wind there has been so bad that i mean they <unk> tried to plant grass
wind	wind_nou	the wind will take away a lot of body heat
wind	wind_nou	but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature
wind	wind_nou	but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
wind	wind_nou	but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit and a thick wet suit at that because it s just extremely cold
wind	wind_nou	it it s kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know uh just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
wind	wind_nou	i mean we <unk> talking you know forty five fifty minutes for biking uh and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind
graduate	graduate_adj-nou	because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts
lead	lead_nou-vrb	and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands and that innocent people
present	present_adj-nou	and you wrap the present up
