close	close_vrb	I would like to close with a thought that will perhaps unite us all: I am able to remain quite composed throughout this entire debate for I really do believe that we are on the right road, because I know that the European car manufacturers and, more importantly, the European automotive suppliers - for they really are the driving force behind European industry - have not been asleep in recent years but have been working on a whole series of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to achieve our objectives.
close	close_vrb	As this debate draws to a close, the request I should therefore like to make to the Commission is that in future we, that is the Council, the Commission and Parliament, discuss how democratic and economic reforms in those countries can be better and more effectively supported and how we can target the PHARE programme more selectively.

close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to assure you that the Commission will examine carefully every specific proposal which Parliament may present within the framework of debates on future regulations.
close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to thank the rapporteur, whose basic positions I agree with.
close	close_vrb	The decision to grant discharge is a single act that cannot be divided up into a political decision on the discharge and a decision to close the accounts, which is to be taken at the same time.

close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to point out that, in the new financial perspectives, where we shall no longer have the Community initiatives as we have known them, we must not forget to also integrate this gender dimension, in keeping with the experience we already have and the new positions and proposals presented today in our rapporteur's proposal.
close	close_vrb	I should like to close by saying that these young farmers do not just need reliable policies; they also need good wives and strong families.
close	close_vrb	. Mr President, I just want to close very briefly, because much of what I said in general terms was a repetition of what we think.
close	close_vrb	Human rights are one of the key factors in addressing the major challenges of our time: I do not need to mention the close connection between peace, security and stability, on the one hand, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, on the other.

close	close_vrb	I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this.
close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to recapitulate: firstly, labelling must be voluntary; secondly, labelling must be dominated by a spirit of transparency, so that no one doubts its reliability; thirdly, labelling must be by an independent authority and fourthly, this effort requires – and I emphasise this even though it is self-evident – fishermen to be present at the talks.
close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, on the effort which he made in successfully achieving a compromise between the divergent opinions formulated by his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and in the various political groups.
close	close_vrb	Speaking of the Doha Round, I staunchly believe that we should try to close that round because it has a lot of important features, among them, that the existing tariffs cannot go up any more, that we would be able to close them down.
close	close_vrb	Before I close, I would like to mention, and indeed to emphasise, the positive atmosphere that prevailed in our meetings with the European Parliament.

close	close_vrb	Officially, according to our agenda, we should close the debate at 11.50 a.m.
close	close_vrb	I would like to close, therefore, by offering my sincere thanks, once again, to all those who were involved.
close	close_vrb	To close, I have this to say: it is very important that we develop mechanisms in the European Union for receiving refugees, for accepting asylum seekers, not just for humanitarian reasons and for the reasons already referred to by numerous members, but also so that we can combat illegal immigration.
close	close_vrb	I would like to close with an observation on the networks.
close	close_vrb	I should like to close, Mr President, by saying that we have a duty to intervene at once in the Middle East in order to protect the Palestinians, in order to protect Israel from anti-Semitism and in order to protect the very future of democracy in Europe.
close	close_vrb	By means of this agreement, reached amongst the majority of political groups in this House, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to close this regulation at second reading and provide political impetus for European construction.
close	close_vrb	To close, I think that a great deal has been said about terrorism, but I wish to draw the Presidency's attention to the fact that the question of terrorism does not end with a few paragraphs.

close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to protest about the time at which this very important subject was tabled for debate.
close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to recapitulate: firstly, labelling must be voluntary; secondly, labelling must be dominated by a spirit of transparency, so that no one doubts its reliability; thirdly, labelling must be by an independent authority and fourthly, this effort requires – and I emphasise this even though it is self-evident – fishermen to be present at the talks.
close	close_vrb	Two more points before I close: I think that attention should be focused more and more in future on neighbouring countries and less and less on the countries joining the European Union, precisely because the risk of squeezing out a nascent private market economy in these countries is greater. Lastly, I turn to the European Union as the majority EBRD shareholder.
close	close_vrb	A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
close	close_vrb	I should like to close with one other point: the ex-ante procedures proposed by the Commission for examining state aid should worry us, not because subsidiarity is being suspended or superseded, but to see if they are compatible with the terms of state aid.
close	close_vrb	Let me close by again praising the outstanding work that the rapporteur has done in drafting this wide-ranging and useful report, which will itself help to make society more aware of multiple sclerosis and of the problems associated with it.
close	close_vrb	To close - and I am sorry that I do not have more time to reply to the very specific issues raised - I should just like to say before I forget, because a number of speakers referred to the economic recovery programmes, that they are indeed a very good idea, because there are numerous benefits from including projects to prevent disasters which we can more or less expect to happen next year as well - as previously said, we discuss these matters every year - both because they will generate economic activity and create more jobs and because they will prevent damage costing millions of euros in restoration works.
close	close_vrb	To close, I should like to stress that I shall take account of Parliament's opinion and I shall evaluate the positions formulated both in Parliament and in the Council.
close	close_vrb	I would like to close by saying to you that this Statute, although not perfect, is a step forward, a step towards true European democracy.
close	close_vrb	The time has come for Serbia to close this painful chapter and to make a new step towards reconciliation in the region.
close	close_vrb	I should like to close, Mr President, with a wish: that from now on the Council will operate with greater transparency, that it will talk to the rapporteurs early on, that it will attend European Parliament committees not simply to strengthen the role of the European Parliament but so that faster decisions can be taken, faster than the 16 kilometres an hour which is the present average speed of the railways.
close	close_vrb	To close, I wish to point out that, in the new financial perspectives, where we shall no longer have the Community initiatives as we have known them, we must not forget to also integrate this gender dimension, in keeping with the experience we already have and the new positions and proposals presented today in our rapporteur's proposal.
close	close_vrb	At the close of the financial year 2002, the available balance amounted to almost EUR 3 000 million. Outstanding commitments awaiting settlement amounted to more than EUR 8 000 million.

close	close_vrb	When you see the behaviour of the directors of many companies, especially the multinationals, who decide to restructure, relocate or even partially or totally close down their businesses, making hundreds or thousands of workers unemployed simply to cut costs and/or increase profits, it is all the more intolerable that the Council should not have accepted proposals that we have adopted in this House.

lead	lead_nou	It is not true to say that lead is banned in toys.
lead	lead_nou	Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.
lead	lead_nou	This waste contains lead, cadmium, barium, mercury, brominated flame retardants and other chemicals and plastics that become hazardous when burned.
lead	lead_nou	But it cannot be denied that air pollution in our cities, including Lisbon and Oporto, frequently reaches levels that threaten public health, and that recent studies confirm that the lead content in children's blood in risk zones and in urban areas exceeds admissible levels.
lead	lead_nou	The problem is the high levels of lead in the paints used in these toys.
lead	lead_nou	It is inexplicable why cadmium and lead are still permitted in children's toys.
lead	lead_nou	Lead stabilisers, in other words organotin and lead compounds, are the most relevant ones and the environmental risks are higher, especially in the case of lead stabilisers.
lead	lead_nou	I want to make it clear that we are not suggesting that Member States should eliminate lead within five years.

lead	lead_nou	I want to make it clear that we are not suggesting that Member States should eliminate lead within five years.
lead	lead_nou	Specifically, it is surprising that there has been insufficient discussion of the problem of copper which, in the Commission's proposal, has been inserted into the table relating to chemical parameters - which lists poisons such as arsenic, cyanide, mercury, lead, etc. instead of appearing in the table relating to indicator parameters, which are used to check and speed up measurements of possible changes in water quality whose beneficial properties are clearly highlighted in the report issued by the World Health Organization in October 1996.

live	live_vrb	But it seems that these Inuits live in sumptuous houses on the west coast or the east coast, or in Amsterdam, or in Paris, or in Tel Aviv. One of the miracles of leg-traps is that the whole planet is inhabited by Inuits.
live	live_vrb	It leads one to believe that it is mainly the rich countries that were unable to live up to agreements. The opening-up of markets, more investment and more development aid are cases in point.
live	live_vrb	I would also like to emphasise that promoting active citizenship must be undertaken for all of the Union’s citizens, by no means overlooking those who live in regions that are far from the centre of Europe, particularly the citizens of the outermost regions.
live	live_vrb	People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.
live	live_vrb	As more and more people in the European Union live, work, study and spend part of their lives in countries other than the one in which they were born or of which they are nominally citizens, this is going to become more and more necessary.
live	live_vrb	We can also, on the other hand, make daily life easier for those who live on opposite sides of the external borders, but do so nonetheless as good neighbours.
live	live_vrb	The greatest cost of all is borne by those who live in poor countries.
live	live_vrb	By far the majority of women who have undergone genital mutilation - reference is made to 130 million - live in Africa.
live	live_vrb	We must measure the additional costs faced by these regions and help them so that these areas have the same development opportunities as others and so that the people who live there are not penalised.
live	live_vrb	It leads one to believe that it is mainly the rich countries that were unable to live up to agreements. The opening-up of markets, more investment and more development aid are cases in point.
live	live_vrb	Citizens who live on either side of these borders and who speak the same language and foster close family and cultural ties will not be able to find sufficient words to express the importance of being able to cross borders without any barrier or visa.
live	live_vrb	Those who live in poor areas of large European cities can expect their lives, on average, to be 28 years shorter than those who live in wealthier areas.

live	live_vrb	If people are to live together harmoniously, the various topics concerning transport, society and education must be linked together effectively.
live	live_vrb	But by changing the context in which people live, by giving them the same rules and the same democratic institutions, we can succeed in changing the way they behave towards each other.
live	live_vrb	Civil servants in developing countries, who live on low, public sector wages, are struggling to keep their families out of poverty.
live	live_vrb	People round about us live in fear of being arrested, beaten and humiliated, as too often happens.
live	live_vrb	There are a huge number of Romanian children who live with their families in other Member States and it is important for them to preserve their identity and to be offered the chance to study both the language of the country they are living in and their mother tongue.
live	live_vrb	It is certainly the case that the Palestinians in Gaza live in a perpetual state of privation, and this is inhumane.
live	live_vrb	Mr Peterle has said it all: we want our citizens to live long and healthy lives.
live	live_vrb	We certainly need to do much more to ensure that the conditions under which women and mothers live and work do not result in any discrimination in the world of politics.
live	live_vrb	In my opinion, European civil servants should have the same rights as those who live in any State of the Union.
live	live_vrb	They are parties that live outside society: an expression of this - read last month' s Eurobarometer - is the ever-increasing distance between you, your bureaucracies and the citizens.
live	live_vrb	This may be the case for patients who live in border regions, where healthcare provided abroad is sometimes closer than that provided in their own country.
live	live_vrb	The text completely overlooks the situation of degradation in which the Roma communities live, in certain states such as Italy, not due to lack of integration policies but, quite the contrary, due to a deliberate decision to reject any rule of civil living.
live	live_vrb	Probably that would be up to at least half the standard of the rest of continental Europe, but it is very welcome to those of us who live in that area.
live	live_vrb	Whilst certain small countries live primarily off external demand, the large countries always rely primarily on internal demand.
live	live_vrb	Mr Peterle has said it all: we want our citizens to live long and healthy lives.
live	live_vrb	Citizens who live on either side of these borders, speak the same language and foster close family and cultural ties are unable, for their part, to find sufficient words to express the importance of being able to cross borders without any barrier or visa.
live	live_vrb	People who live near schools where nearby fields are sprayed and people who work or live near sprayed fields have an enormously high exposure to pesticides.
live	live_vrb	One million Tamils live in the north; the other three million live in peace in the south with the Sinhalese.
live	live_vrb	Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas.
live	live_vrb	We need to understand that fishermen live in an especially dangerous situation as, while all the vessels passing through the area are cause for concern, the merchant vessels tend to have established routes, which provides greater opportunity to monitor them as they pass through.
live	live_vrb	When Baroness Ashton goes to Lapland, she will find a lot of people who live and work north of the Arctic Circle.
live	live_vrb	Perhaps people could consider whether it would be possible to put eco-labels on certain areas where people work and live in a certain way, and also provide increased aid via the Structural Funds.
live	live_vrb	The fact that 1.2 billion people living in the rural areas of developing countries live in poverty is a shocking indictment of the developed world, but equally the long-term development and sustainability of Third World economies depend on our efforts and - hopefully - success in helping them to develop and add value to their natural resources, with corresponding measures to assist with market access for their products.
live	live_vrb	We have to ensure that all European citizens can live out their retirement with dignity.
live	live_vrb	The people who live around the Mediterranean have needed no vote by a European Parliament to establish relations among each other, as they have done since time immemorial.
live	live_vrb	Poor people live in the short term, in a day-today struggle to put food on the table.
live	live_vrb	We know that most people in Europe live in towns and that current transport conditions are anything but optimal.
live	live_vrb	Clearly the worst is the situation of those who live in remote localities, segregated settlements, often without access to school, electricity or running water, and in the regions with very high unemployment.
live	live_vrb	I would like to point out that not all women in rural areas live in the same way.
live	live_vrb	One billion two hundred thousand people live below the poverty threshold - which, I would point out, is a mere USD 1 a day - and I feel that this is the matter weighing on the civil and political consciences of all of us here, and it is right that it should.
live	live_vrb	We must make rural development work for people and the places in which they live.
live	live_vrb	We have to develop a territorial approach that suits the specific social conditions of the regions where most Roma live, and we have to do more to create employment for unskilled or low skilled people.
live	live_vrb	Our culture programme reaches citizens where they live, which is our stated goal.
live	live_vrb	I must add that there is a worrying racial aspect to this issue: the black immigrant labourers work separately, live separately and were removed separately by the police, having been fired upon and urged to leave the area around Rozzano, Calabria.
live	live_vrb	There are also many species that have not yet been discovered and described. Most of these live in the soil or in rotting wood and are highly sensitive to change.
live	live_vrb	The Roma live in many European countries - both Western and Eastern countries.
live	live_vrb	These are people who live in insecurity every day, but who do not give up on their commitment to fight for an Iraq free of the military occupation, terrorism and armed resistance.
live	live_vrb	These kinds of irresponsible statements are offensive to those who wish to live in a free, tolerant and open Poland.
live	live_vrb	But it also states that we are entitled to take up employment in one country and live in another country, for example like transfrontier workers, who live in one country and have insurance in another.
live	live_vrb	The contribution that the visitors who have come to live amongst us have made to life in many of our countries must be recognised and celebrated.
live	live_vrb	It is an absolute ethical commitment which we must make our priority in order to allow our children to live in a future in which the values and the joys of living must not be jeopardized by the chemistry of drugs.
live	live_vrb	But it also states that we are entitled to take up employment in one country and live in another country, for example like transfrontier workers, who live in one country and have insurance in another.
live	live_vrb	Women have the right to live in safety, but a great number are not even safe in their own homes.
live	live_vrb	It is an inalienable part of the European system of values that every individual should be allowed to live according to his or her religion and practise it.
live	live_vrb	Therefore, the progress of incorporating non-citizens into local communities must go hand in hand with their resolution to accept that they live in Latvia or Estonia, that they are becoming citizens of the European Union, and not some other union.
live	live_vrb	The people of Diego Garcia have been denied the right to live in their own homeland.
live	live_vrb	There are problems on the labour market due to insecure contracts of employment and wages on which it is impossible to live.
live	live_vrb	That 36 million people have to live with the HIV virus and that millions die of it every year must surely make an impression on those who only care about unborn lives and leave those who have been born to suffer and die.
live	live_vrb	The people of Diego Garcia have been denied the right to live in their own homeland.
live	live_vrb	We are very much in favour of the Palestinians being given a state in a dignified manner, and we are also very much in favour of Israel being able to live within secure borders.
live	live_vrb	Our fellow citizens are prepared to live with this document as an interim report on their common history but have no desire to be taken hostage by it for decades, with all movement on what was the European compromise at the beginning of the twenty-first century indefinitely postponed.
live	live_vrb	And how can anyone live on the margin, Mrs Pailler, without having the misfortune to lapse into practices that may become criminal?
live	live_vrb	Saddam Hussein is certainly responsible and guilty, but we are also incurring a great deal of responsibility and guilt in continuing with a policy which maintains the population of a country in extreme poverty, a population such as the Iraqi people, with a rich history and culture, a population made up of people, women, children, who want to live.
live	live_vrb	They have been demonstrating for their right to catch fish, to earn their living and to live in freedom and peace.
live	live_vrb	We must reaffirm unequivocally the right of the Israeli people to live in peace and security within their internationally recognized and guaranteed borders.
live	live_vrb	The proposal will ensure that this programme will make all European towns and cities better places to live and work and healthier places to bring up our children and go about our daily lives.
live	live_vrb	It really is time that Europe's last divided capital at last became a living capital again and that Cypriots of both ethnic groups could live together in Cyprus in peace.
live	live_vrb	Well, the transitional period of three years would have at least had the merit of showing us that we can very easily live, on the one hand, with a euro that is living its own rather chaotic life on the international markets and, on the other hand, with national currencies still in circulation, to the great satisfaction of consumers.
live	live_vrb	More privatization also means that women will have to pay more premiums into private pension schemes if they live longer, and I wonder whether this will actually be the case.
live	live_vrb	Let us live out in our daily lives the values of solidarity and brotherhood, adopting for ourselves the beautiful words of the writer Carlos Fuentes, which I quote: ' Our culture is not made from isolation but from communication, confrontation and contagion.
live	live_vrb	We must acknowledge that science and technology allow us to live longer, to live under better conditions, to live with a more confident outlook and taking into account that food security conditions have improved, that the conditions of our welfare systems have improved, that conditions in our forward-looking world have improved, precisely because it has been able to use and exploit science and technology.
live	live_vrb	The strangers who come knocking at our door more often than not come from countries which have completely failed to let their population live decently, or even to feed it.
live	live_vrb	Yet, in the Western Sahara, there are dead and wounded people of a population that is only claiming the right to live in freedom in its own land.
live	live_vrb	Yet, in Europe, many women and young girls continue to live in the shadow of aggression or exploitation.
live	live_vrb	... and to have a State of Israel that can live in safety.
live	live_vrb	Needing as we do the riches of the earth in order to live, we seek them out, process them and use them.
live	live_vrb	We must accept that those who endure poverty have a right to live in dignity and participate in social and economic life.
live	live_vrb	I agree 100% that Israelis have a right to live without the threat of rocket attacks.
live	live_vrb	A society which seeks to develop prosperity and justice, and which wants more and more people to be able to live in acceptable environments must ensure economic growth.
live	live_vrb	Yet the principle of the right to live as a family is simple.
live	live_vrb	No nation can live and function like that.
live	live_vrb	We must all live together on this globe.
live	live_vrb	They do not want to live apart. They want to integrate, while retaining their identity.
live	live_vrb	On that point, I consider its advocacy of the establishment of a minimum income threshold in all Member States to be of great value, so that everyone, whether or not they are employed, can live with dignity.
live	live_vrb	We have been told many times by the new world that farmers have to live in that they have to face up to responsibilities and the marketplace and yet here we are preventing them from being able to compete in buying those medicines.
live	live_vrb	I wish we were all there, together with those Palestinians and those Israelis who continue to believe that the best form of security for all peoples, for all people, lies in the mutual acknowledgement of the right to exist and live in one's own land in democracy and freedom.
live	live_vrb	Everyone is entitled to decent housing and an income which allows them to live honourably.
live	live_vrb	If we live in a European democracy, then of course, the core components of our constitutions must be mutually agreed and must be compatible with the international treaties that we have all signed.
live	live_vrb	We do not live in a perfect world.
live	live_vrb	We live in an internal market with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.
live	live_vrb	I actually believe, and your intention was clear, that there is not really much point in Parliament and some of our fellow Members repeatedly criticising, month after month, global capitalism or total capitalism: we live in a world in which competition is becoming tougher and tougher and in which the future of the car industry is undoubtedly determined more by Renault-Nissan-GM alliances such as those announced, than by processes about which we are speaking today.
live	live_vrb	I think that we live in a world now where food production is becoming very important again and we have to look to the future.
live	live_vrb	The bottom line is that we live in a European Union where there is a system of free movement of services, capital, goods and persons.
live	live_vrb	Those of us who live in the region are sick and tired of crises.
live	live_vrb	Unfortunately, we live in an integrated European Union with a common market and most often all those decisions fail to have the sort of effect they once had.
live	live_vrb	We do live, after all, in the twenty-first century.
live	live_vrb	Mr President, we live in a world characterised by great material wealth, but the wealth is unevenly distributed.

present	present_vrb	In its meeting on 28 May 1998, the Council adopted conclusions on encryption and law enforcement to guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of digital communications which present considerable advantages for electronic commerce and the private lives of individuals and which can also help to prevent fraud and other crimes.
present	present_vrb	Modern information and communication technologies in themselves present an unprecedented opportunity to really promote cohesion and equal opportunities, but we can only use this opportunity if we guarantee the conditions to include everyone throughout their lives, so that, even for 'eskills', the title of the Committee's opinion will inevitably be true: 'It is never too late'.
present	present_vrb	The new government should present an EU integration programme for implementation on all pending issues.
present	present_vrb	The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages, such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets.
present	present_vrb	Mr President, I am taking the floor on behalf of Mr Pittella, from Italy, and Mrs Madeira, from Portugal, to ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, in the proposals on the financial perspective that it is to present, to reincorporate the criteria proposed by the Commission on the regions affected by the statistical effect, with regard to the need to support them without any shameful discrimination amongst them, since, as I said in this very House on 9 March, this is a question of dignity, of making European policy comprehensible, of making it egalitarian, balanced and democratic, faithful to its roots and to its ambitions.
present	present_vrb	As for the FIFG, we support the strategy of the report aimed at unifying regulations on activities in this sector, but we do not feel it necessary or even appropriate to present such a complete document at this stage as, for that very reason, we have not been able to sufficiently discuss all its implications.
present	present_vrb	The parties were given the opportunity to present written and oral comments.
present	present_vrb	We will continue our efforts to present a new long-term programme for 1998 and the year 2000.
present	present_vrb	The Commission has decided to present a proposal which not only respects this own resources ceiling but also allows sufficient scope below this ceiling based on the average over the period.
present	present_vrb	I therefore believe that the British Presidency has a great opportunity to present proposals aimed at making these objectives a reality.
present	present_vrb	Mr President, obviously the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are those who suffer most in the conflicts between armed gangs which are tearing the country apart, but it is both pathetic and misleading to present these conflicts as if the only people to bear any responsibility were the opposing Congolese factions and their protectors in neighbouring African states and as if Europe' s calling for national reconciliation and democratisation could resolve the situation.
present	present_vrb	It is a hypocritical attempt to present budget appropriations as available for unemployment and for employment, at a time when not a single ECU has been added to the European Union budget and when the titles of certain lines are simply being changed.
present	present_vrb	I believe that the Commission could present either a proposal, for example, in the framework of consumer protection - consumer in this instance meaning citizen - or an initiative, which could also come from Parliament.
present	present_vrb	It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.
present	present_vrb	We should be the first to present different initiatives at conferences or whatever, to exchange good practice, and so on.
present	present_vrb	The Commission announced its intention to present a Green Paper on forest protection and information in the context of the 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change.
present	present_vrb	And this is proposed without even allowing the accused to put his case, denying any opportunity to present a defence, and this in regard to the chairman of a group here in this Parliament and an Austrian politician.
present	present_vrb	I have voted against the resolution, because I cannot see why we should now throw away the Statute we have adopted and present the Council not with a law on the legal position of MEPs, but with mere pay scales, of which we cannot be other than ashamed and for which the public will laugh us to scorn.
present	present_vrb	Today, we learn from the press that the Italian Government has decided not to present the resolution to the UN.
present	present_vrb	This revision will enable us to present a single coherent wording, free of any contradictory definitions, to increase the transparency and clarity of the legislation on equality of treatment and to facilitate effective implementation by reinforcing the , avoiding any regression and incorporating all recent developments of European jurisprudence.
present	present_vrb	Another question is whether it can be stated with absolute certainty that such a series of stress tests will not ignore any bank whose operation might present a risk to the European economy.
present	present_vrb	We have tried to present a more acceptable formulation, which, sadly, I think is unlikely to succeed here at today's vote, and I would therefore urge colleagues to support the deletion, to allow us to return to this at conciliation and do the work properly.
present	present_vrb	rapporteur. - Mr President, I am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity to present my report on early years learning in the European Union, which is an extremely important aspect of education that we have not really given much attention to before now.
present	present_vrb	Commissioner, the Commission will have to present the European Council in Feira with a report on the development of a statute for the outermost regions, in accordance with Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
present	present_vrb	The draft budget that I am going to present to you incorporates a number of items that were discussed at length during the traditional conciliation meeting last July.
present	present_vrb	The Commission announced its intention to present a Green Paper on forest protection and information in the context of the 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change.
present	present_vrb	The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.
present	present_vrb	"Madam President, we would like to present an oral amendment to Amendment No 5. Instead of ""triggered by unrest and acts of violence starting in the early sixties"" , we wish to replace the words ""triggered by"" with the words ""which followed"" ."
present	present_vrb	As far as the contradiction between repressive policies and proactive policies is concerned, I feel that the Commission has strived to present a range of proposals that is balanced in both areas.
present	present_vrb	As rapporteur, I must present the report on behalf of the committee, although personally I am not in favour of some of the committee amendments, notably the refusal to place a time limit on liability for damage occasioned by land filling.
present	present_vrb	Mr Dimitrakopoulos, if you would like to present your oral amendment, Parliament will decide.
present	present_vrb	Above all, I am very pleased to see that Parliament has had the courage to present our reports in the 'Lisbon' package to honour the promise made to the citizens to inform them of the consequences of this treaty.
present	present_vrb	I would like to present the Commission's positions with regard to it.
present	present_vrb	The difficulty that this report may present is the nature of the European authentic act or public document itself, which is recognised in most of the countries in the European Union but not in others.
present	present_vrb	I will therefore try to present his report to you.
present	present_vrb	The report aims to present the 1999 budget as a bridging budget between the financial perspective which is ending and that which we are discussing.
present	present_vrb	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to present briefly the basic aspects of the critical issues dealt with by the four reports.
present	present_vrb	I will therefore end by calling on the Commission to present these proposals very soon, that is to say, immediately after it receives those studies, so that, next year, Parliament can study them and recommend to the Member States what decisions should be taken, without any excessive delay.
present	present_vrb	I believe that it was Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who said that if a State wants to apologise, present or express remorse or regret, at the end of the day, it is up to that State to know how far it can go.
present	present_vrb	The rapporteur is going to present a technical modification of paragraph 120 rather than an oral amendment.
present	present_vrb	Mr President, I am now putting on a different hat to present my report to Parliament.
present	present_vrb	I ask you, fellow-Members, to start work and to present us with its results as soon as you possibly can.
present	present_vrb	It notes the messages contained in other amendments, and will present the result of its deliberations as and when appropriate.
present	present_vrb	The annual economic report that the Commission will present in just over a month' s time, indeed as part of the preparations for the Spring Council, will contain a detailed analysis of the situation, and substantial progress will, at last, have to be made in Barcelona.
present	present_vrb	The Commission will soon present a framework decision on procedural safeguards and we are convinced that the initiative we will be taking in June this year to present a framework decision on minimum rules for data protection, under the third pillar, will be equally significant.
present	present_vrb	In addition, the Commission will soon be adopting its second report on the incorporation of the money laundering Directive into national law, and expects to present it to Parliament before the summer recess.
present	present_vrb	On this, the Commission will present its report in the autumn, and, like all its predecessors, this report will be fair and objective.
present	present_vrb	It will present the study by 30 September 2013 at the latest and incorporate the positive results from the study into additional legislation.
present	present_vrb	As you know, in the spring, the Commission will present a strategy for completing the transition to a low carbon economy by 2050.
present	present_vrb	In order to take account of this fact and the many and varied viewpoints and concerns manifested on this subject, the Commission will present a proposal to the committee concerned to remove the sub-species from Annex 1 to Council Directive 79/409 on the Conservation of Wild Birds.
present	present_vrb	The communication which the Commission will present at the informal summit in Lahti sets out such an approach.
present	present_vrb	The Commission is analysing the situation and will soon present proposals on the basis of Cotonou Agreement, as was called for by Mr Kohlíček, Mr Gahler and Mr Tannock.
present	present_vrb	Will the Commission present a new proposal in the health area?
present	present_vrb	I think, therefore, that we should wait for the outcome of the two ongoing studies and discuss this issue on the basis of a report that the Commission will present to Parliament and the Council in 2005.
present	present_vrb	We shall discuss this matter again together, Parliament, the Council and both of us with the Commission, which will soon present its summary report to us.
present	present_vrb	The Commission will also present the legal framework for capturing and storing CO2, with the necessary guarantees on environmental protection.
present	present_vrb	Other issues left pending from the Barcelona European Council and which will be addressed by the Seville Council are: the simplification and improvement of regulations - known as 'better regulation'; economic services of general interest - the Commission will also present the report that has been requested of it; energy supply - on which it will present another report; telecommunications, education, research; the outermost regions and sustainable development.
present	present_vrb	In 2012, the Commission will present a communication assessing in depth the implementation of active inclusion strategies at national level.

produce	produce_nou	In Northern Ireland, we rely heavily on the ability to export produce to the rest of the UK and other European countries.

produce	produce_nou	It is within the capacities of European agriculture to use agricultural land no longer required for food production to produce energy in the form of biomass.
produce	produce_nou	The European agricultural policy came about in order to support our farmers and enhance the quality of European produce, so as to strengthen the EU's position in the world marketplace.
produce	produce_nou	It is vital for farmers, whose prime function is to produce farm products, not to have to bear a higher rate than 5 % against a world context of greater demand and smaller stocks.
produce	produce_nou	Moreover, there is a way of achieving this: by radically changing the way that we produce and use energy in our society.
produce	produce_nou	Agricultural produce is a large element of ACP exports.
produce	produce_nou	We believe that the market in general must be opened up for agricultural produce, which also includes soft fruits and cherries intended for processing.

produce	produce_nou	It has been very important for us to try to help them, perhaps not to continue to produce sugar if they could not be competitive, but then to try to do something else.

produce	produce_nou	We import a huge amount of cotton and what we do produce in no way supports exportation.
produce	produce_nou	The 18 main produce types introduced by the new Member States are an issue that has still not been regulated.

produce	produce_nou	The vested interests that produce these should be legally liable for insuring people's health if something goes wrong.
produce	produce_nou	in writing. - I voted against this report as I question the propriety of granting Iceland any concessions regarding the importation of fisheries produce into the EU when they continue to persist with their approach on the management of mackerel, with the negative impact this is likely to have on EU pelagic fishermen.
produce	produce_nou	For example, farmers ought to be paid for their produce within 30 days.
produce	produce_nou	Local produce, such as berries and mushrooms, can contribute to a region's trademark image, strengthen its identity, its gastronomic reputation and encourage green tourism, which is essential to the rural economy.
produce	produce_nou	Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate.
produce	produce_nou	In order to encourage car manufacturers to continually increase the number of environmentally friendly cars they produce, consideration needs to be given, in the case of public procurement, to the costs incurred throughout the entire lifetime of the respective vehicles and their impact on the environment and public health.
produce	produce_nou	It is clear for everyone to see that there is a worldwide growing demand for organic produce, and the EU Member States are no exception.
produce	produce_nou	The conclusions from the report debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight to us that importing agricultural produce from third countries has a much greater detrimental impact on the environment than internal production, which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, making it conducive to climate change.
produce	produce_nou	In addition to this, the appearance on their market of produce subsidised by the CAP will represent a real threat to their agriculture.
produce	produce_nou	It is therefore only right that we respect first the land, which yields the produce, then the processor, if any, but above all the consumer.
produce	produce_nou	But we need more if we want to give our Mediterranean policy a new lease of life: we need to involve the people more by supporting decentralised cooperation, we need to improve the way in which the cultural and human dimensions are integrated, open the free trade zone to agricultural produce and monitor and support fundamental freedoms.
produce	produce_nou	It is within the capacities of European agriculture to use agricultural land no longer required for food production to produce energy in the form of biomass.
produce	produce_nou	People are paying higher prices for organic produce.
produce	produce_nou	The third reason has to do with who produces and owns the agricultural produce in numerous developing countries, where farming and agricultural produce are owned by huge multinationals paying starvation wages.
produce	produce_nou	Given the difficulties the people there have in exporting their agricultural produce and the difficulties the Members experienced in travelling there, I cannot see how, in the event of a disaster, for example, these people could possibly cope without adequate resources.
produce	produce_nou	We have to change our agricultural policy so that we no longer dump produce on the developing countries' markets.
produce	produce_nou	The second has to do with the international system of prices and subsidies for agricultural produce and the international system of prices for industrial goods.
produce	produce_nou	A new definition of healthy eating has been initiated; one of the stipulations is that healthy eating is possible only with organic produce.
produce	produce_nou	These subsidies seriously damage the prospects of other countries, particularly developing ones, of maintaining a viable position on the market in agricultural produce.
produce	produce_nou	Let me quote: ‘The rate of aid paid for artificially dried fodder is almost double that paid for sun-dried fodder. This encouraged producers to switch from sun-drying and to produce artificially dried fodder to the maximum extent possible.
produce	produce_nou	It seems to me a good thing for farmers on a voluntary basis to add value to their produce through quality assurance schemes, and we should be supporting them, not discouraging them.
produce	produce_nou	There has also been much talk of the effect of diverting agricultural produce to the production of biofuels as one of the main reasons for the increase in food prices.
produce	produce_nou	On the other hand, another approach could be to exploit the produce of the land, such as fruit and the produce of the underwood, and to operate a system of controlled tree felling, which would produce an annual income of FF 2 000. In this case, the income would be regular, practically perennial.
produce	produce_nou	With its endless reforms of the CAP, the European Union is becoming more and more product-deficient, ruining farmers and, at the same time, forcing developing countries, with extortionate agreements and price mechanisms, to sell their agricultural produce at knock-down prices, tightening the noose around the neck of their people and protecting the multinationals' profits.
produce	produce_nou	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to European regulations that have laid down firm rules on the quality of agricultural produce, the health of citizens, environmental sustainability, and the specific characteristics of crops, we can say today with pride that European agriculture is a model without equal in the world.
